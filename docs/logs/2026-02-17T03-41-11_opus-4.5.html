First, let me identify potential groupings:

1. **Knots**: SHEEPSHANK, HITCH, BOWLINE, BEND - these are all types of knots used in sailing/rope work. This seems like a strong category.

2. **Nonsense/Baloney words**: CROCK, BUNK, HORSEFEATHERS, HOGWASH - these all mean "nonsense" or "baloney." CROCK (as in "crock of..."), BUNK (bunkum), HORSEFEATHERS, HOGWASH are all slang for nonsense.

3. **Track and Field events**: BATON (relay), HURDLE, POLE (vault), HAMMER (throw) - these are all related to track and field events.

4. **Devil-related imagery**: HORNS, GOATEE, PITCHFORK, TAIL - these are all associated with the devil's appearance. The devil is often depicted with horns, a goatee, a pitchfork, and a tail.

Let me verify my groupings:
- Knots: SHEEPSHANK ✓, HITCH ✓, BOWLINE ✓, BEND ✓
- Nonsense words: CROCK ✓, BUNK ✓, HORSEFEATHERS ✓, HOGWASH ✓
- Track &amp; Field: BATON ✓, HURDLE ✓, POLE ✓, HAMMER ✓
- Devil features: HORNS ✓, GOATEE ✓, PITCHFORK ✓, TAIL ✓

All 16 words fit perfectly into these 4 categories! 

I'm most confident about the "nonsense/baloney" category because these are very distinctly slang terms for nonsense. Let me start with that one.

Actually, the devil features category also seems very strong and specific. Let me go with the nonsense words first as they're all clearly synonyms.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

3. **Devil features**: HORNS, GOATEE, PITCHFORK, TAIL - all associated with the devil's appearance

2. **Track and Field events**: BATON (relay), HURDLE, POLE (vault), HAMMER (throw)

Both categories seem very solid. Let me go with the knots category next. 
- SHEEPSHANK: a type of knot used to shorten rope
- HITCH: a type of knot used to attach rope to an object
- BOWLINE: a type of knot that creates a fixed loop

Available words: SWEAT, TRAIL, TOWEL, BLUSH, GRADE, TIGER, DYE, FIDGET, RATE, STOCKINGS, SCORE, PACE, RANK, MASCARA, NOSE, CLIP

Let me look for potential categories:

1. Words that can follow "RUN":
- SWEAT (no)
- TRAIL (no)
- TOWEL (no)
- RATE (no)
- Actually, let me think about what can come before or after these words.

2. Makeup/cosmetics:
- BLUSH (yes)
- MASCARA (yes)
- Hmm, that's only 2 obvious ones.

3. Words related to rating/ranking:
- GRADE
- RATE
- SCORE
- RANK
These all relate to evaluating or ranking something! This looks like a strong category.

4. Let me think about compound words or phrases:
- TIGER: Tiger Balm, Tiger Lily, Paper Tiger
- TRAIL: Trail mix, Paper Trail
- TOWEL: Towel rack, Paper Towel
- CLIP: Paper Clip!

5. Things that can follow "PAPER":
- TOWEL (paper towel)
- TRAIL (paper trail)
- TIGER (paper tiger)
- CLIP (paper clip)
This seems like a strong category!

6. Let me verify the rating/ranking category:
- GRADE (to grade, a grade)
- RATE (to rate, a rate)
- SCORE (to score, a score)
- RANK (to rank, a rank)
- PACE (to pace... not really rating)
All of these can be verbs meaning to evaluate/assess.

7. Words related to running (in stockings):
- STOCKINGS can have a "run"
- Wait, what about things that "run"?
- NOSE (runny nose, nose runs)
- STOCKINGS (run in stockings)
- DYE (dye runs)
- MASCARA (mascara runs)

Let me reconsider:
Things that can RUN:
- NOSE (your nose runs)
- STOCKINGS (run in stockings)
- DYE (dye runs)
- MASCARA (mascara runs)
This is a strong category!

So I have:
1. PAPER ___: TOWEL, TRAIL, TIGER, CLIP
2. Things that RUN: NOSE, STOCKINGS, DYE, MASCARA
3. Rating words: GRADE, RATE, SCORE, RANK

That leaves: SWEAT, BLUSH, FIDGET, PACE

What do SWEAT, BLUSH, FIDGET, PACE have in common?
- These could all be signs of nervousness!
- You sweat when nervous
- You blush when nervous/embarrassed
- You fidget when nervous
- You pace when nervous
Yes! These are all things you do when nervous!

Let me verify my categories:
1. PAPER ___: TOWEL, TRAIL, TIGER, CLIP ✓
2. Things that RUN: NOSE, STOCKINGS, DYE, MASCARA ✓
3. Rating/ranking verbs: GRADE, RATE, SCORE, RANK ✓
4. Signs of nervousness: SWEAT, BLUSH, FIDGET, PACE ✓

I'm most confident about the PAPER ___ category, so I'll start with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: SWEAT, TRAIL, BLUSH, GRADE, DYE, FIDGET, RATE, STOCKINGS, SCORE, PACE, RANK, MASCARA, NOSE

Wait, TRAIL was used in the previous guess, so it shouldn't be in the remaining words. Let me reconsider.

Actually, the remaining words should be: SWEAT, BLUSH, GRADE, DYE, FIDGET, RATE, STOCKINGS, SCORE, PACE, RANK, MASCARA, NOSE

My previously identified categories:
1. Things that RUN: NOSE, STOCKINGS, DYE, MASCARA
2. Rating/ranking verbs: GRADE, RATE, SCORE, RANK
3. Signs of nervousness: SWEAT, BLUSH, FIDGET, PACE

Let me verify these again:

Things that RUN:
- NOSE (your nose runs when you have a cold)
- STOCKINGS (you get a run in your stockings)
- DYE (dye runs/bleeds)
- MASCARA (mascara runs when you cry)
This seems solid!

Rating/ranking words:
- GRADE (to grade something)
- RATE (to rate something)
- SCORE (to score something)
- RANK (to rank something)
This also seems very solid!

Signs of nervousness:
- SWEAT (you sweat when nervous)
- BLUSH (you blush when embarrassed/nervous)
- FIDGET (you fidget when nervous)
- PACE (you pace when nervous/anxious)
This also works well!

I'll go with the rating/ranking category next as it seems very straightforward.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Signs of nervousness:

Available words: COCO, DIRECTOR, CHAIR, CHEST, BROWN, GREEN, GROUNDS, FICTION, HAZEL, PEA, HEAD, UNCHAINED, FIELD, DOGS, CHIEF, LAWN

Let me think about potential connections:

1. **Django movies**: COCO, UNCHAINED, DOGS - Wait, "Django Unchained" is a movie. Let me think about Tarantino films... "Reservoir Dogs" is one too. Could there be a pattern with movie titles?

2. **Eye colors**: BROWN, GREEN, HAZEL - these are all eye colors! What could be the fourth? BLUE is missing... but maybe there's another pattern.

3. **Types of coats**: PEA (pea coat), FIELD (field jacket?), CHEST... no, that doesn't work.

4. **___ COAT**: PEA coat, FIELD coat... not sure about others.

5. **Shades of green things**: PEA green, LAWN green, FIELD green... 

6. **Executive positions**: DIRECTOR, CHAIR, HEAD, CHIEF - these could all be leadership/executive titles! Chair (chairman), Chief (like Chief Executive), Director, Head (like Head of Department)

7. **Pulp ___**: FICTION (Pulp Fiction is a movie)

8. **Tarantino movies**: "Pulp Fiction", "Reservoir Dogs", "Django Unchained"... what about COCO? No, that's Pixar.

9. **___ GREEN**: LAWN green? Let me think differently.

10. **Coffee related**: GROUNDS (coffee grounds), BROWN...

11. **Things that can follow a word**: 
- LAWN: chair, mower...
- EXECUTIVE: director, chair, chef?

Let me reconsider the executive positions: DIRECTOR, CHAIR, HEAD, CHIEF - these all could be titles for leaders. "Executive Director", "Executive Chair", "Chief Executive", "Head"... or they could all precede "OFFICER" or follow "EXECUTIVE"

Actually, wait - could these all go with "EXECUTIVE"?
- Executive Director ✓
- Executive Chair ✓
- Chief Executive ✓
- Head... Executive Head? Not common.

Let me think about "___ OFFICER":
- Chief Officer ✓
- Field Officer ✓

What about "RESERVATION" related:
- "Reservation Dogs" is a TV show
- Indian reservation...

Let me reconsider movies with single-word additions:
- "Django Unchained"
- "Reservoir Dogs" 
- "Pulp Fiction"
- What could complete this? These are all Tarantino films!

But I need words that appear in my list. I have UNCHAINED, DOGS, FICTION... but not DJANGO, RESERVOIR, or PULP.

Wait, maybe it's "Quentin Tarantino film + one word" pattern? Let me check what words could complete Tarantino titles:
- DOGS (Reservoir Dogs)
- FICTION (Pulp Fiction)
- UNCHAINED (Django Unchained)
- What's the fourth? "Kill Bill"... BROWN (Jackie Brown)! Yes!

So: DOGS, FICTION, UNCHAINED, BROWN - all words from Tarantino movie titles!

This seems like a strong connection. Let me verify:
- Reservoir DOGS ✓
- Pulp FICTION ✓
- Django UNCHAINED ✓
- Jackie BROWN ✓

This looks like a solid guess!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

   - Executive Chair (or Chairman)
   - Head (of department)
   - Chief (Executive, or Chief Officer)
   
   Actually, these could all follow "EXECUTIVE" or precede some common word...

3. **___ COAT**: PEA coat, FIELD coat... CHEST... no.

4. **Types of ___**: 
   - LAWN, FIELD, GROUNDS - outdoor areas?

5. **Coffee terms**: GROUNDS (coffee grounds)...

6. **Pixar movies**: COCO is a Pixar movie. What else? 

7. **Chanel**: COCO Chanel...

8. **___ NUT**: COCO-nut, HAZEL-nut, CHEST-nut, PEA-nut? Wait!
   - COCOnut ✓
   - HAZELnut ✓
   - CHESTnut ✓
   - PEAnut ✓
   
   This is a strong pattern! All of these can precede "NUT"!

Let me go with the ___NUT pattern: COCO, HAZEL, CHEST, PEA

This seems very solid!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
COCO, HAZEL, CHEST, PEA

Remaining words: DIRECTOR, CHAIR, GREEN, GROUNDS, HEAD, FIELD, CHIEF, LAWN

Let me analyze these:

1. **Executive/Leadership titles**: DIRECTOR, CHAIR, HEAD, CHIEF
   - Executive Director ✓
   - Executive Chair ✓
   - Executive Head... not as common
   - Chief Executive ✓
   
   Hmm, but could these all work with something else?

2. **Outdoor areas/surfaces**: GREEN, GROUNDS, FIELD, LAWN
   - These are all outdoor grassy areas or surfaces
   - Golf: GREEN (putting green), GROUNDS (golf grounds?)
   - Sports: FIELD
   - LAWN - yard area
   
   Actually, these could all be related to outdoor grassy areas!

3. **___ HOCKEY**: FIELD hockey ✓, but not the others...

4. **School-related**: 
   - HEAD (headmaster)
   - GROUNDS (school grounds)
   - DIRECTOR (director of...)
   - FIELD (field trip?)

5. **Could follow "PLAYING"**:
   - Playing FIELD ✓
   - Playing... no, that doesn't work for others

6. **Things at a school or institution**:
   - GROUNDS (school grounds)
   - FIELD (playing field)
   - GREEN (the green/lawn area)
   - LAWN (campus lawn)

Wait, let me think about what could precede or follow all of these...

**___ CHAIR**: LAWN chair ✓, DIRECTOR's chair ✓, FIELD chair? No...

**LAWN ___**: LAWN chair, LAWN mower...

Let me reconsider. Could GREEN, GROUNDS, FIELD, LAWN all be types of outdoor grass areas? Or places you'd find at a country club or golf course?
- GREEN (putting green)
- GROUNDS (club grounds)
- FIELD (playing field)
- LAWN (lawn area)

Or maybe they can all follow a word like "VILLAGE" or "TOWN"?
- Village GREEN ✓
- Village... no

What about "CAMP" or "FAIR" or... "PLAYING"?
- Playing FIELD ✓
- Not others...

Let me think about DIRECTOR, CHAIR, HEAD, CHIEF again - could they all be types of leaders or positions?
- DIRECTOR - leadership role
- CHAIR - chairman, leadership role
- HEAD - head of department, leadership
- CHIEF - chief officer, leadership

These could all be executive or leadership titles. Let me try this group.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

GREEN, GROUNDS, FIELD, LAWN

These must form the final category. Let me think about what connects them:

1. They're all outdoor grassy areas
2. They could all relate to golf (putting GREEN, GROUNDS, FIELD?, LAWN?)
3. They could all be places at a school or estate

But more specifically, what's the connection the puzzle makers intended?

- VILLAGE GREEN
- COFFEE GROUNDS? No wait, that's different
- PLAYING FIELD
- LAWN... 

Could they all follow "BOWLING"?
- Bowling GREEN ✓ (Bowling Green is a place/term)
- Bowling... no

Could they all be related to something specific?

Wait - could they all precede or follow a common word?

- GREEN room, GREEN house
- GROUNDS keeper
- FIELD trip, FIELD day
- LAWN mower, LAWN chair

Hmm, what about things that can come before "KEEPER"?
- GROUNDS keeper ✓
- FIELD... no
- GREEN... no
- LAWN... no

These are the last four, so they must be the answer. The connection is likely that they're all outdoor grassy/landscaped areas, or perhaps they all can follow or precede a specific word I'm not thinking of.

Since these are the only four remaining, this is my final guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Available words: ALE, LOUNGE, TABLE, EEK, VEG, COUNTER, LOAF, TAP, BOOTH, SWIPE, PINCH, HIVE, CHILL, BAR, SCROLL, QUASH

Let me think about possible groupings:

1. **Phone/touchscreen gestures**: TAP, SWIPE, PINCH, SCROLL - these are all touchscreen gestures you do on a phone or tablet. This seems like a strong connection!

2. **Things in a bar/pub**: ALE, TAP, BAR, BOOTH, COUNTER - wait, that's 5 words. Let me reconsider. ALE is a drink, TAP is for beer, BAR is the place, BOOTH is seating, COUNTER is where you sit...

3. **Relax/do nothing**: LOUNGE, VEG, LOAF, CHILL - these all mean to relax or be lazy! LOUNGE around, VEG out, LOAF around, CHILL out. This is another strong connection!

4. **Types of minds**: HIVE mind... that's one. Let me think differently.

5. **___ MIND compounds**: HIVE mind... what else could go with MIND? 

6. **Suppress/squash**: QUASH means to suppress. SWIPE could mean steal informally...

7. **Types of seating/furniture**: LOUNGE, TABLE, BOOTH, BAR (as in bar stool area)

8. **Bee-related**: HIVE, SWIPE (no...), 

9. **Small amounts**: PINCH (a pinch of salt), TAP...

Let me reconsider the strongest categories:

**Touchscreen gestures**: TAP, SWIPE, PINCH, SCROLL - This is very solid. All four are common gestures used on smartphones and tablets.

**Relax/idle verbs**: LOUNGE, VEG, LOAF, CHILL - All can mean to relax or be idle. You can "lounge around," "veg out," "loaf around," and "chill out."

**Bar/restaurant items**: TABLE, COUNTER, BOOTH, BAR - These could all be places to sit or surfaces at a restaurant/bar.

**Remaining**: ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH

Wait, let me think about EEK. That's an exclamation. Could there be a pattern with words that can follow something?

What about "___ MIND"? HIVE mind... 

Or "BEE___"? BEEHIVE... 

What about words that can follow "SQUASH"? QUASH sounds like squash...

Let me think about "___BAR": CROWBAR, HANDLEBAR...

Or "BAR___": BARTENDER...

Actually, let me reconsider. Could some of these be types of something?

EEK, QUASH... these are unusual words. 

Wait - could they all go with a common word?
- TABLE can be a verb (to table a motion)
- COUNTER can be a verb (to counter an argument)
- QUASH is to suppress
- BAR can be a verb (to bar someone from entering)

Hmm, let me think about what goes after these words or before them.

I'm most confident about the touchscreen gestures: TAP, SWIPE, PINCH, SCROLL

Let me start with that guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now let me work with the remaining 12 words:

ALE, LOUNGE, TABLE, EEK, VEG, COUNTER, LOAF, BOOTH, HIVE, CHILL, BAR, QUASH

Let me revisit my earlier analysis:

**Relax/idle verbs**: LOUNGE, VEG, LOAF, CHILL - All can mean to relax or be idle. "Lounge around," "veg out," "loaf around," "chill out." This still seems very strong.

**Bar/restaurant seating areas**: TABLE, COUNTER, BOOTH, BAR - These are all places where you might sit at a restaurant or bar.

**Remaining after those two categories**: ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH

Let me think about ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH:
- Could these follow or precede a common word?
- ALE - GINGER ALE, PALE ALE
- EEK - exclamation
- HIVE - BEEHIVE
- QUASH - to suppress

What about "BEE" words?
- BEEHIVE ✓
- BEE... ALE? No
- BEE... EEK? No

What about words ending in the same sound or letter patterns?

Wait, could these be hidden words or sounds?
- HIVE sounds like "HIGH-V" or contains "IV"
- QUASH contains "QUA"
- EEK contains double E

Let me think differently. What if there's a word that can precede all of them?
- ___ ALE
- ___ EEK
- ___ HIVE
- ___ QUASH

GINGER ALE... GINGER EEK? No.

What about words that can come AFTER?
- ALE ___
- EEK ___
- HIVE ___
- QUASH ___

Hmm, that doesn't work either.

Let me focus on my strong category: Relax/idle verbs

ALE, TABLE, EEK, COUNTER, BOOTH, HIVE, BAR, QUASH

My earlier hypothesis was:
**Bar/restaurant seating areas**: TABLE, COUNTER, BOOTH, BAR - These are all places where you might sit at a restaurant or bar.

That would leave: ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH

Let me think about what connects ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH:
- Could they all follow or precede a common letter or word?
- ALE - ends in ALE
- EEK - has double E
- HIVE - ends in IVE
- QUASH - ends in ASH

Wait, what if these can all follow a single letter?
- B + ALE = BALE
- B + EEK = BEEK? No, but BEAK? No...

What about single letters in front?
- G + ALE = GALE ✓
- P + EEK = PEEK ✓
- F + IVE... wait, HIVE not IVE
- G + HIVE? No...

Hmm, let me think about adding letters to the beginning:
- ALE: BALE, DALE, GALE, MALE, PALE, SALE, TALE, VALE, WHALE
- EEK: GEEK, LEEK, MEEK, PEEK, REEK, SEEK, WEEK
- HIVE: CHIVE... that's about it
- QUASH: SQUASH!

What about adding "S" to the beginning?
- S + ALE = SALE ✓
- S + EEK = SEEK ✓
- S + HIVE? No...
- S + QUASH = SQUASH ✓

What about adding different letters?
- C + HIVE = CHIVE
- C + ALE? No
- C + QUASH? No

Let me think about the restaurant seating again: TABLE, COUNTER, BOOTH, BAR

Actually, could these all go with "PHONE"?
- PHONE BOOTH ✓
- PHONE TABLE? No
- PHONE BAR? No

What about types of something?
- VOTING BOOTH
- PHONE BOOTH
- TABLE... POOL TABLE
- BAR... SALAD BAR

Hmm, could they all precede or follow the same word?

What about "___ EXAM" or something legal/court related?
- BAR EXAM ✓
- QUASH (legal term) ✓
- COUNTER (as in counterargument)
- TABLE (to table a motion)

Wait, these could all be legal/courtroom terms!
- BAR - the bar exam, the bar (legal profession)
- QUASH - to quash a subpoena
- TABLE - to table a motion
- COUNTER - to counter an argument

But then what about BOOTH, ALE, EEK, HIVE?

- QUASH - to suppress or put an end to

What could connect these four seemingly unrelated words?

Let me think about adding letters:

First, let me look for obvious categories:

1. **TV/Media formats or channels**: VHS, MTV, NES, ALF
   - VHS is a video format
   - MTV is a music television channel
   - NES is Nintendo Entertainment System (gaming console)
   - ALF is a TV show (Alien Life Form)
   - These are all from the 1980s era... but they're different types of things

2. **Words that can follow "MOTHER"**: 
   - MOTHER + BOND? No
   - MOTHER + DAY = Mother's Day ✓
   - MOTHER + BIRTH? No (but BIRTH + MOTHER?)
   - This might not work well

3. **Words that can precede "DAY"**:
   - BIRTH + DAY = Birthday ✓
   - WED + DAY? No, it's WEDNESDAY but that's WED-NES-DAY
   - Wait... WED-NES-DAY could be split into WED, NES, DAY!
   - Let me think about other compound days...

4. **Words that spell WEDNESDAY**: WED + NES + DAY
   - That's only 3 words though

5. **Words related to beginnings**:
   - START, BIRTH, DAWN, GENESIS - all mean beginning!
   - This looks like a strong category!

6. **Words that can follow "SUN"**:
   - SUN + FLOWER = Sunflower ✓
   - SUN + DAWN? No
   - SUN + DAY = Sunday ✓
   - SUN + BIRTH? No

7. **Words that can precede "POWER"**:
   - FLOWER POWER ✓
   - What else?

8. **Three-letter abbreviations**: NES, VHS, MTV, ALF
   - These are all 3-letter acronyms from the 80s!
   - NES = Nintendo Entertainment System
   - VHS = Video Home System
   - MTV = Music Television
   - ALF = Alien Life Form (TV show)
   - But ALF is a show name, not quite the same category...

9. **Words meaning "beginning/origin"**: GENESIS, BIRTH, DAWN, START
   - GENESIS = beginning
   - BIRTH = beginning of life
   - DAWN = beginning of day
   - START = beginning
   - This seems very strong!

10. **Words that can follow "POLE"**: POLE POSITION, POLE VAULT, POLE DANCE, POLE STAR... 
    - Actually, looking at POLE as part of a category

11. **Words that can combine with another word**:
    - BOND: James Bond, Bond girl
    - COMBINE: harvester
    - FLY: housefly, butterfly
    - FUSE: blow a fuse

12. **Words related to joining/uniting**: BOND, COMBINE, FUSE, WED
    - BOND = to join together
    - COMBINE = to merge
    - FUSE = to melt together
    - WED = to marry/join
    - This is a strong category too!

Let me verify my two strongest guesses:
- Beginnings: GENESIS, BIRTH, DAWN, START ✓
- Joining/Uniting: BOND, COMBINE, FUSE, WED ✓

I'll go with the "joining/uniting" category first as it seems very solid.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: START, BIRTH, NES, FLY, FLOWER, DAWN, DAY, POLE, ALF, GENESIS, VHS, MTV

Let me revisit my earlier analysis:

1. **Words meaning "beginning/origin"**: GENESIS, BIRTH, DAWN, START
   - GENESIS = beginning (also the book of the Bible about creation)
   - BIRTH = beginning of life
   - DAWN = beginning of day
   - START = beginning
   - This still looks very strong!

2. **80s era acronyms/abbreviations**: NES, VHS, MTV, ALF
   - NES = Nintendo Entertainment System
   - VHS = Video Home System
   - MTV = Music Television
   - ALF = Alien Life Form (TV show from the 80s)
   - These are all 3-letter things from the 1980s

3. **Words that can follow a direction (NORTH, SOUTH, etc.)**:
   - NORTH POLE ✓
   - SOUTH POLE ✓
   - What about NORTH STAR, NORTH DAY? No...

4. **Words that can precede or follow something**:
   - FLY: BUTTERFLY, FIREFLY, HOUSEFLY, FLY FISHING
   - FLOWER: SUNFLOWER, FLOWER POWER, FLOWER GIRL
   - POLE: NORTH POLE, POLE VAULT, POLE POSITION
   - DAY: BIRTHDAY, SUNDAY, DAYTIME

5. **___ FLY compound words**:
   - BAR + FLY = Barfly
   - BUTTER + FLY = Butterfly
   - FIRE + FLY = Firefly
   - HORSE + FLY = Horsefly

Wait, let me think about what could connect FLY, FLOWER, POLE, DAY...
- MAY + FLY = Mayfly ✓
- MAY + FLOWER = Mayflower ✓
- MAY + POLE = Maypole ✓
- MAY + DAY = May Day ✓

That's it! Words that can follow "MAY": FLY, FLOWER, POLE, DAY

I'm very confident in this one, and it's more specific than the "beginnings" category, so let me go with this.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Two down, two to go. Let me look at the remaining 8 words:

Remaining words: START, BIRTH, NES, DAWN, ALF, GENESIS, VHS, MTV

My earlier identified categories:

1. **Words meaning "beginning/origin"**: GENESIS, BIRTH, DAWN, START
   - GENESIS = beginning (also the book of the Bible about creation)
   - BIRTH = beginning of life
   - DAWN = beginning of day
   - START = beginning
   - This still looks very strong!

2. **80s era things**: NES, VHS, MTV, ALF
   - NES = Nintendo Entertainment System (1985)
   - VHS = Video Home System (popular in 80s)
   - MTV = Music Television (launched 1981)
   - ALF = TV show (1986-1990)
   
   But what's the specific connection? They're all acronyms/initialisms from the 1980s, but that seems a bit loose. Let me think more...

   Actually, could these all be things that debuted or were popular in a specific year? Or maybe they're all things that can precede or follow a common word?

   Wait - could there be another pattern? Let me think about what these have in common:
   - They're all 3 letters
   - They're all abbreviations/acronyms
   - They're all from the 80s pop culture

   Or maybe there's a different grouping I'm missing?

Let me reconsider. The "beginnings" category seems very solid:
- GENESIS, BIRTH, DAWN, START - all synonyms for beginning/origin

That would leave: NES, VHS, MTV, ALF as the final group, which must have some connection. Since I'm confident about the beginnings category, let me go with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: NES, ALF, VHS, MTV

These are all:

Let me think about what specifically connects them:
- NES = Nintendo Entertainment System (gaming console, 1985)
- ALF = Alien Life Form (TV show, 1986-1990)
- VHS = Video Home System (video format, popular in 80s)

They're all 1980s pop culture acronyms/initialisms. But there might be a more specific connection...

Actually, wait - could they all be things that can precede or follow a specific word? Or be part of a phrase?

Hmm, let me just go with this as the final group since it's the only remaining option. The connection is likely "80s acronyms" or "three-letter abbreviations from the 1980s" or something similar.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me identify what each word could mean:
- LARK: bird, or a fun activity
- FORD: car brand, or to cross water
- FRY: cook method, or young fish
- ROCKET: spacecraft, or a type of salad green
- SCRAPER: tool for scraping
- WING: part of bird/plane, or a section of building
- STAR: celestial body, or famous person
- FLYER: something that flies, or an advertisement
- CHIP: piece of something, potato chip, computer chip
- SENATOR: political position
- LINCOLN: president, car brand
- DIP: sauce, or to lower into something
- RAM: male sheep, or to hit forcefully
- DODGE: car brand, or to avoid
- DUCK: bird, or to lower your head
- DIVE: to plunge, or a bar

Let me look for patterns:

1. Car brands: FORD, LINCOLN, DODGE, RAM (all are car/truck brands - Ford, Lincoln, Dodge, Ram)

2. NHL teams: FLYER (Philadelphia Flyers), SENATOR (Ottawa Senators), STAR (Dallas Stars), DUCK (Anaheim Ducks) - these could all be NHL team names!

3. Birds: LARK, DUCK (but Duck might be NHL)

4. Ways to avoid something / movements: DODGE, DUCK, DIVE, DIP - wait, these are all things you do to avoid something! "Dodge, duck, dip, dive" - this is from the movie Dodgeball! The 5 D's of dodgeball!

5. Words that can follow "SKY": SCRAPER, DIVE, ROCKET, LARK?

Let me reconsider:
- DODGE, DUCK, DIP, DIVE - The 5 D's of Dodgeball (from the movie)
- FORD, LINCOLN, RAM, DODGE - but DODGE might be in the Dodgeball category

Wait, let me think about this more carefully:
- Car brands: FORD, LINCOLN, RAM... and we need a 4th. DODGE is both a car brand and a Dodgeball word.

NHL teams: FLYER, SENATOR, STAR, DUCK (but DUCK is also a Dodgeball word)

The Dodgeball reference seems very specific: "Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive, and Dodge" - so DODGE, DUCK, DIP, DIVE

But this creates overlap. Let me reconsider what's most likely.

Actually, looking at potential categories:
- Car brands: FORD, LINCOLN, RAM, DODGE (4 exact)
- NHL teams: FLYER (Flyers), SENATOR (Senators), STAR (Stars), DUCK (Ducks) - 4 exact
- Dodgeball 5 D's: DODGE, DUCK, DIP, DIVE - 4 exact

There's overlap with DODGE and DUCK. So one of these categories must be wrong, or the puzzle is designed so that only one of these is correct.

Let me think about other possibilities:
- WING, CHIP, FRY, DIP - could these be food-related? Chicken wing, chip, fry... and dip goes with chips
- ROCKET, SCRAPER, LARK - these need a connection

SKY + word: SCRAPER (skyscraper), ROCKET (sky rocket), LARK (skylark), DIVE (skydive)? That's 4!

So potentially:
1. SKY___: SCRAPER, ROCKET, LARK, DIVE (skyscraper, sky rocket, skylark, skydive)
2. Car brands: FORD, LINCOLN, RAM, DODGE
3. NHL teams: FLYER, SENATOR, STAR, DUCK (if DIVE is in SKY category)
4. Remaining: WING, CHIP, FRY, DIP - could these go with CHICKEN? Chicken wing, chicken chip(?), chicken fry(?), chicken dip(?)

Actually, FRY could be "small fry" or fried food. Let me think...
- WING, FRY, CHIP, DIP - things you might order at a bar/restaurant appetizers?

I'm most confident about the car brands: FORD, LINCOLN, RAM, DODGE</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me reconsider my earlier analysis:

1. NHL teams: FLYER (Philadelphia Flyers), SENATOR (Ottawa Senators), STAR (Dallas Stars), DUCK (Anaheim Ducks) - this still looks very strong

2. SKY + word: SCRAPER (skyscraper), ROCKET (sky rocket), LARK (skylark), DIVE (skydive) - this also looks strong

3. Remaining would be: FRY, WING, CHIP, DIP
   - These could all go with CHICKEN: chicken wing, chicken fry (a dish), chicken chip(?), chicken dip
   - Or they could be bar food/appetizers
   - Actually, WING, CHIP, FRY could be British food terms (chips = fries in UK)
   - Or BUFFALO ___: Buffalo wing, Buffalo chip?, Buffalo...

Wait, let me think about FISH:
- FRY (fish fry, or baby fish are called fry)
- CHIP (fish and chips)
- DIP (fish dip?)
- Could WING fit? Not really fish-related

Let me think about BUFFALO:
- BUFFALO WING (yes!)
- BUFFALO CHIP (yes, this is a thing - dried buffalo dung, or a famous rally)
- BUFFALO... FRY? DIP?

Hmm, what about things that can follow BUFFALO:
- WING (Buffalo wing)
- CHIP (Buffalo chip)
- Actually, there's also Buffalo Soldier, Buffalo Bill...

Let me revisit my earlier analysis:

1. SKY + word: SCRAPER (skyscraper), ROCKET (sky rocket), LARK (skylark), DIVE (skydive)
   - This still looks very strong - all four make compound words or phrases with SKY

2. Remaining would be: FRY, WING, CHIP, DIP
   - These could relate to food
   - WING - chicken wing, buffalo wing
   - CHIP - potato chip, tortilla chip
   - DIP - a sauce, or to dip food
   - FRY - to cook, or french fry, or small fry (baby fish)
   
   What connects these four?
   - Could they all follow a word? SMALL: small fry (yes), small chip(?), small dip(?), small wing(?)
   - Could they all precede a word?
   - BAR food? Wings, chips, dip... fry?
   - BUFFALO: buffalo wing, buffalo chip... but not buffalo fry or buffalo dip
   
   Actually, thinking about it differently:
   - CHIP, DIP - you dip chips
   - WING - you can dip wings
   - FRY - you can dip fries
   
   These are all things you DIP! Or things served with dipping sauce at a restaurant/bar.
   
   Or they could all be SMALL ___: small fry (yes!), but the others don't work as well.
   
   Or ___ SHOT: wing shot? chip shot (golf)! dip? fry?
   
   Hmm, CHIP SHOT is definitely a golf term. What about others?

2. Things you can DIP - you dip chips, wings, fries in dip/sauce
3. Could they all follow or precede a common word?

- WING: chicken wing, buffalo wing, wing nut, wing man
- DIP: skinny dip, dip stick

First, let me look for obvious categories:

1. Chinese Dynasties: TANG, HAN, MING - these are definitely Chinese dynasties. I need a fourth one. SONG is also a Chinese dynasty! So TANG, HAN, MING, SONG could be a group.

2. Male animals: STAG (male deer), BUCK (male deer), RAM (male sheep), BILLY (male goat) - these are all terms for male animals! This looks like a strong category.

3. Words that can follow "FREE": FREE KICK, FREE SOLO, FREE PUNCH? Let me think... FREE JACK? Maybe not this pattern.

4. Words meaning energy/excitement: ZEST, ZING, KICK, PUNCH - these all can mean liveliness or energy/excitement in something. "This dish has real ZEST/ZING/KICK/PUNCH to it."

5. Looking at what's left if I remove the above categories:
- From dynasties: TANG, HAN, MING, SONG
- From male animals: STAG, BUCK, RAM, BILLY
- From energy words: ZEST, ZING, KICK, PUNCH
- Remaining: FREE, JACK, SINGLE, SOLO

Wait, let me reconsider. FREE, JACK, SINGLE, SOLO... 
- SOLO can mean alone
- SINGLE means one/alone
- FREE could mean unattached
- JACK... Blackjack terms? Hit, stand... Jack is a card.

Actually, let me think about "_____ party":
- STAG party
- SINGLE party? No...

What about types of punches or drinks?
- PUNCH is a drink
- Could TANG be related (like Tang the orange drink)?

Let me reconsider the male animals category - this seems very solid:
STAG (male deer), BUCK (male deer/rabbit), RAM (male sheep), BILLY (billy goat - male goat)

Let me reconsider:

- BUCK - male deer, but also a dollar
- RAM - male sheep, but also the zodiac sign Aries, or to hit something
- BILLY - male goat, but also a name, or billy club

Maybe the male animals category isn't quite right, or one of these words belongs to a different category.

Let me think about Chinese Dynasties again - this seems very solid:
TANG, HAN, MING, SONG - all Chinese dynasties. This is historically accurate.

Let me try this category instead since it's factually verifiable.

Other potential categories to consider after:

Words meaning energy/pizzazz: ZEST, ZING, KICK, PUNCH - "this has real zing/zest/kick/punch to it"

What about the remaining words: FREE, JACK, SINGLE, SOLO, STAG, BUCK, RAM, BILLY

Could there be a "types of parties" connection?
- STAG party
- BACHELOR party? No, bachelor isn't here
- SINGLE? 

Or could JACK, BUCK, RAM be related in another way?
- JACK can be a name, a playing card, or part of blackjack
- These could all be things that precede another word?

2. Male animals: STAG, BUCK, RAM, BILLY - This was wrong before, so at least one doesn't fit.

3. Let me think about what other connections there might be:

- SOLO = alone
- SINGLE = alone
- STAG = going alone to an event

Hmm, what about words meaning "alone" or "unaccompanied":
- SOLO - alone
- SINGLE - alone/unmarried
- STAG - going alone (stag = without a date)
- FREE - unattached?

Or maybe JACK fits somewhere else:
- Blackjack?
- Jumping jack?
- Jack rabbit? JACK + RABBIT = JACKRABBIT

Wait! Compound words with animals:
- JACKRABBIT (JACK + rabbit)
- RAMROD? RAM + rod? Or just RAM as in battering ram?

2. Male animals:

- JACK knife
- BUCK knife (hunting knife)
- BOWIE knife? No BOWIE here

Hmm, let me think about Dodge vehicles:
- Dodge RAM
- ... 

Or zodiac signs:
- RAM = Aries
- Not seeing others

Let me try the "alone/unaccompanied" theme:
SOLO, SINGLE, STAG, FREE - all can mean doing something alone or being unattached

Actually, I'm fairly confident in this. Going to a party SOLO, SINGLE, STAG, or FREE all suggest going without a partner/date.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- RAM - male sheep
- BILLY - male goat (billy goat)
- JACK - male donkey! A jack is a male donkey/ass

Yes! JACK is a male donkey. So all four are terms for male animals:
- JACK - male donkey
- BUCK - male deer (or rabbit)
- RAM - male sheep

First, let me list all the words:
SPLIT, FICTIONAL BOXER, CUP, SPACECRAFT, LIBERAL, DEPARTED, THEATER, GREEK/ROMAN GOD, LEFT, BLUE, RAINMAKER, MARTIAN, SHAKE, PROGRESSIVE, CONE, GOOD SHEPHERD

Let me look for patterns:

1. Some words could relate to "LEFT" politically: LIBERAL, LEFT, PROGRESSIVE, BLUE (as in blue states)

2. Some words could be types of ice cream servings/styles:
- SPLIT (banana split)
- CUP (ice cream cup)
- CONE (ice cream cone)
- SHAKE (milkshake)

3. Looking at some words that might be Matt Damon movies:
- DEPARTED (The Departed)
- MARTIAN (The Martian)
- RAINMAKER (The Rainmaker)
- GOOD SHEPHERD (The Good Shepherd)

Wait, let me think about this differently. Some of these look like they could be crossword puzzle clues or category descriptions:
- FICTIONAL BOXER could be ROCKY or APOLLO
- GREEK/ROMAN GOD could be APOLLO
- SPACECRAFT could be APOLLO

4. APOLLO connection:
- FICTIONAL BOXER (Apollo Creed from Rocky)
- SPACECRAFT (Apollo missions)
- GREEK/ROMAN GOD (Apollo the god)
- THEATER (Apollo Theater in Harlem)

This seems like a strong category! These could all precede or follow "APOLLO"

5. Matt Damon movies - let me verify:
- THE DEPARTED - Yes, Matt Damon
- THE MARTIAN - Yes, Matt Damon
- THE RAINMAKER - Yes, Matt Damon
- THE GOOD SHEPHERD - Yes, Matt Damon

6. Political left/liberal:
- LEFT, LIBERAL, PROGRESSIVE, BLUE - all relate to left-wing politics

7. Ice cream:
- SPLIT, CUP, CONE, SHAKE - ice cream servings

Let me reconsider the APOLLO category vs Matt Damon movies. The Matt Damon movies seem very solid:
- The Departed (2006)
- The Martian (2015)
- The Rainmaker (1997)
- The Good Shepherd (2006)

All confirmed Matt Damon films with "THE" in front.

The APOLLO connection:
- Apollo Creed (FICTIONAL BOXER)
- Apollo spacecraft (SPACECRAFT)
- Apollo the god (GREEK/ROMAN GOD)
- Apollo Theater (THEATER)

This seems like these are all things that can be called "APOLLO"

I'm going to start with the Matt Damon movies since I'm very confident about those.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words:
SPLIT, FICTIONAL BOXER, CUP, SPACECRAFT, LIBERAL, THEATER, GREEK/ROMAN GOD, LEFT, BLUE, SHAKE, PROGRESSIVE, CONE

Now let me reassess my earlier theories:

1. APOLLO connection - things that can be called "APOLLO":
- FICTIONAL BOXER (Apollo Creed from Rocky)
- SPACECRAFT (Apollo missions)
- GREEK/ROMAN GOD (Apollo the god)
- THEATER (Apollo Theater in Harlem)

2. Political left/liberal:
- LEFT, LIBERAL, PROGRESSIVE, BLUE - all relate to left-wing politics

3. Ice cream servings:
- SPLIT (banana split)
- CUP (ice cream cup)
- CONE (ice cream cone)
- SHAKE (milkshake)

All three of these categories seem very strong. Let me go with the APOLLO connection since it's a clever puzzle-type answer where each clue describes something named APOLLO.

- FICTIONAL BOXER = Apollo Creed
- SPACECRAFT = Apollo 11, etc.
- GREEK/ROMAN GOD = Apollo
- THEATER = Apollo Theater

This feels like a classic Connections puzzle category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

My two remaining theories:

2. Ice cream servings:
- SPLIT (banana split)
- CUP (ice cream cup)
- CONE (ice cream cone)
- SHAKE (milkshake)

Both categories have exactly 4 words each, which is perfect. Let me go with the ice cream category since it's very concrete.

- SPLIT = banana split
- CUP = ice cream in a cup
- CONE = ice cream cone
- SHAKE = milkshake

First, let me list all words: GUTHRIE, SCROOGE, CHUCK, WOODEN, FOGHORN, STIFF, AWKWARD, WOOD, WOODY, CREATE, STILTED, THEREFORE, CLASSICS, WOODSTOCK, WOODCHUCK, COULD

Let me look for patterns:

1. Words related to "WOOD":
- WOODEN, WOOD, WOODY, WOODSTOCK, WOODCHUCK
That's 5 words, so not all of them can be in one category.

2. Famous people named "Woody":
- WOODY GUTHRIE (folk singer)
- WOODY ALLEN (director)
- WOODY (from Toy Story)
- WOODY WOODPECKER
Wait, let me think about "___ Woody" or "Woody ___"

3. Looking at GUTHRIE, SCROOGE, FOGHORN, WOODSTOCK, WOODCHUCK:
- WOODY GUTHRIE (singer)
- EBENEZER SCROOGE (but could be SCROOGE McDuck)
- FOGHORN LEGHORN (cartoon character)
- WOODSTOCK (Snoopy's bird friend, or the festival)
- WOODCHUCK (as in "how much wood could a woodchuck chuck")

4. Words meaning "stiff" or "unnatural":
- WOODEN, STIFF, AWKWARD, STILTED
These all can describe awkward/unnatural performance or manner!

5. Looking at CHUCK, COULD, WOOD, WOODCHUCK:
"How much wood could a woodchuck chuck" - these are all words from this tongue twister!
CHUCK, COULD, WOOD, WOODCHUCK - Yes!

6. Looking at CREATE, THEREFORE, CLASSICS:
- These seem unrelated at first...
- Wait, could these be related to phrases or word combinations?

Let me reconsider the "Woody ___" pattern:
- WOODY GUTHRIE
- WOODY ALLEN (but ALLEN isn't here)
- WOODY from Toy Story

Actually, let me think about "_____ Woody" or first names:
- Characters/people named Woody: Woody Guthrie, Woody Allen, Woody Harrelson, Woody from Cheers (played by WOODY Harrelson)

Wait, let me think about Looney Tunes/cartoon characters:
- FOGHORN (Leghorn)
- SCROOGE (McDuck - actually that's Disney)
- WOODY (Woodpecker)
- WOODSTOCK (Peanuts)

Hmm, these are mixed cartoons.

Let me reconsider the tongue twister: "How much WOOD COULD a WOODCHUCK CHUCK"
That's 4 words from the available list! This seems very strong.

Let me also verify the "awkward/unnatural" category:
WOODEN (acting), STIFF, AWKWARD, STILTED - all describe unnatural or uncomfortable manner/performance.

I'm most confident about the tongue twister words: WOOD, COULD, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK

Actually wait - let me also consider if these could be "____ Classic" or "Classic ____":
- WOODY Classic? CREATE Classic? 

Or words that can follow "WOULD":
- COULD sounds like WOULD...

Let me go with the tongue twister: WOOD, COULD, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: GUTHRIE, SCROOGE, WOODEN, FOGHORN, STIFF, AWKWARD, WOODY, CREATE, STILTED, THEREFORE, CLASSICS, WOODSTOCK

Let me analyze the remaining patterns:

1. Words meaning "stiff" or "unnatural" in manner/performance:
- WOODEN (wooden acting)
- STIFF (stiff performance)
- AWKWARD (awkward manner)
- STILTED (stilted dialogue/manner)
This seems like a strong category - all describe unnatural or uncomfortable behavior/performance.

2. "Woody ___" famous people/characters:
- WOODY GUTHRIE (folk singer)
- WOODY ALLEN (but ALLEN isn't here)
- WOODSTOCK... wait, that's not "Woody ___"

3. Let me think about names that can follow "WOODY":
- GUTHRIE (Woody Guthrie)
- Could SCROOGE work? No...
- WOODSTOCK is from Peanuts (Snoopy's bird)

4. Turner Classic Movies or similar:
- CLASSICS, CREATE... TCM = Turner Classic Movies
- Could there be a TCM pattern?

5. Let me think about "____ Leghorn" or cartoon characters:
- FOGHORN Leghorn
- SCROOGE McDuck (Disney)
- WOODSTOCK (Peanuts)
- WOODY Woodpecker

Hmm, these are all different cartoon universes.

6. Words that can precede or follow another word:
- THEREFORE, CREATE... these seem odd

Let me think about Latin phrases or mottos:
- THEREFORE could relate to "ergo" or "QED"

Actually, let me think about college/university connections:
- UCLA Bruins coach John WOODEN
- CLASSICS department
- GUTHRIE theater?

Wait - could these be things associated with "JOHN"?
- John WOODEN (basketball coach)
- John GUTHRIE? No, that's Woody Guthrie or Arlo Guthrie

Let me reconsider: Famous coaches named after these?
- John WOODEN (UCLA basketball)

I'm most confident about the "awkward/stiff" synonyms: WOODEN, STIFF, AWKWARD, STILTED

Let me go with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- WOODY Harrelson (actor)

2. Cartoon/comic characters:

- WOODY (Woodpecker, or Toy Story)

Wait, could these all be names that follow "WOODY"?

- WOODY WOODSTOCK? No...

Let me think differently. What about Turner Classic Movies (TCM)?
- T = ?
- C = CLASSICS or CREATE?
- M = ?

Hmm, let me think about network/channel abbreviations:
- TCM = Turner CLASSIC Movies
- Could there be HBO, ESPN patterns?

Words in famous phrases:

- CLASSICS
- CREATE

8. Let me think about phrases:

Available words: DOWN, READY, NASA, EAGER, OUTFIT, N.F.L., EAVE, PREPARE, GAME, SUBARU, EQUIP, NOAA, PARAMOUNT, WILLING, ABLE, CANE

Let me look for patterns:

1. Words that can follow "READY": Ready, willing, and able is a phrase. "Ready, willing, and able" - so READY, WILLING, ABLE could be connected. What about a fourth? EAGER could fit - being enthusiastic/prepared.

2. Actually, let me think about "___ and ___" phrases or words that mean similar things:
- READY, WILLING, ABLE, EAGER - all describe being prepared/enthusiastic to do something
- Or wait, "ready, willing, and able" is a famous phrase

3. Let me look for acronyms or abbreviations:
- NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)
- N.F.L. (National Football League)
- NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
- These are all government/organization acronyms... need a fourth
- Could SUBARU be an acronym? Actually, Subaru is a Japanese car company named after the Pleiades star cluster

4. Words that can come before or after a common word:
- DOWN: let down, down payment, etc.
- CANE: sugar cane, candy cane, hurricane
- EAVE: not sure
- GAME: game ready, game day

5. Let me think about car brands or logos with stars:
- SUBARU has stars in its logo
- PARAMOUNT has stars (mountain with stars)
- Could there be others with star themes?

6. Words related to "mountain" or peaks:
- PARAMOUNT (has a mountain logo)
- Could relate to other words?

7. Let me think about anagrams or hidden words:
- EAVE contains... 
- CANE could be an anagram of ACNE
- NOAA...

8. Words that can precede "HURRICANE":
- CANE is part of hurriCANE
- Could others have hidden words?

9. Let me look for words hidden in other words or that are parts of longer words:
- hurriCANE (CANE)
- Could EAVE be part of something? HEAVEN, WEAVE
- DOWN - DOWNPOUR?

10. Thinking about "TO ___" verbs meaning to supply/prepare:
- OUTFIT (to outfit someone)
- EQUIP (to equip someone)
- PREPARE (to prepare)
- READY (to ready something)

Wait, let me reconsider the READY, WILLING, ABLE group:
- "Ready, willing, and able" is a phrase
- GAME could work too - "game" means willing/ready (as in "I'm game")
- EAGER also fits
- DOWN could mean "I'm down" = I'm willing

So READY, WILLING, ABLE, and either GAME, EAGER, or DOWN could all mean "prepared/enthusiastic"

Actually: READY, WILLING, ABLE, DOWN - all can mean "I'm prepared to do this"
Or: READY, WILLING, ABLE, GAME - "I'm game" = "I'm willing"

Let me think about organizations with star logos:
- SUBARU (Pleiades stars)
- PARAMOUNT (stars around mountain)
- NASA (has stars in imagery)
- N.F.L. (has stars? The NFL logo doesn't prominently feature stars...)

Actually, thinking about logos with mountains:
- PARAMOUNT (famous mountain logo)
- SUBARU? No
- What about hidden "mountain" names?

Let me reconsider: Words that all mean "willing/ready":
READY, WILLING, ABLE, GAME - these all can describe being prepared or willing to do something. "I'm game" = "I'm willing"

I'll go with this as my first guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me reconsider.

Available words: DOWN, READY, NASA, EAGER, OUTFIT, N.F.L., EAVE, PREPARE, GAME, SUBARU, EQUIP, NOAA, PARAMOUNT, WILLING, ABLE, CANE

Let me think more carefully about other patterns:

1. "Ready, willing, and able" is a phrase, but maybe the fourth word isn't GAME. Could it be:
- DOWN ("I'm down" = willing)
- EAGER (enthusiastic)

2. Let me think about acronyms again:
- NASA
- N.F.L.
- NOAA
- What if SUBARU is actually an acronym? I recall there's a myth that SUBARU stands for something in Japanese... but it's actually just the Japanese name for the Pleiades.

3. Words that can follow "SUGAR":
- CANE (sugar cane)
- Could others work? Sugar down? Sugar ready?

4. Let me think about words that can precede a common word:
- DOWN, READY, WILLING, ABLE - could these all precede something?
- "_____ TO" phrases?

5. Hidden words within larger words:
- hurriCANE
- Could EAVE be hidden in something? hEAVEn
- paraNOAA? No...
- Let me think... words that are hidden inside other words:
  - CANE in hurriCANE
  - EAVE in hEAVEn or wEAVE
  - ABLE in? tABLE, cABLE, stABLE
  - What about NASA, N.F.L., etc.?

6. Organizations/brands with logos featuring specific elements:
- PARAMOUNT - mountain with stars
- SUBARU - stars (Pleiades)
- NASA - related to space/stars
- N.F.L. - shield with stars?

7. Let me think about "TO ___" verbs meaning to supply/prepare someone:
- OUTFIT (to outfit)
- EQUIP (to equip)
- PREPARE (to prepare)
- ARM? Not available... 
- READY (to ready)
- GAME? No, that doesn't work as a verb this way

Actually, OUTFIT, EQUIP, PREPARE, and READY could all be verbs meaning "to make ready" or "to supply with necessary items"

8. Another thought - words that can come before "SET":
- READY SET GO
- Could others fit?

9. Think about "_____ and _____" phrases:
- "Ready, willing, and able"
- "Down and out"

10. Words ending in a specific pattern or starting with specific letters forming a hidden message?

Let me try the "verbs meaning to prepare/supply" category:
OUTFIT, EQUIP, PREPARE, READY - these all can mean "to make ready" or "to furnish with necessities"

Actually wait - maybe the connection is different. Let me think about what GAME could connect to differently:
- GAME could be "down" as in "I'm game" / "I'm down"
- But GAME also relates to hunting, sports...

Let me try: OUTFIT, EQUIP, PREPARE, READY - all verbs meaning to make ready/furnish</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
OUTFIT, EQUIP, PREPARE, READY

Remaining words: DOWN, NASA, EAGER, N.F.L., EAVE, GAME, SUBARU, NOAA, PARAMOUNT, WILLING, ABLE, CANE

Now let me look for patterns in the remaining 12 words:

1. "Ready, willing, and able" - but READY is gone. However, WILLING and ABLE are still there. Could there be another connection?

2. Acronyms/Organizations:
- NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)
- N.F.L. (National Football League)
- NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
- Need a fourth... Could SUBARU be treated as an acronym? Or could another word secretly be an acronym?

3. Words meaning "willing/enthusiastic":
- EAGER
- WILLING
- ABLE
- GAME ("I'm game")
- DOWN ("I'm down")

4. Hidden words within larger words:
- CANE in hurriCANE
- EAVE in hEAVEn or wEAVE
- What about others?
- DOWN in... sunDOWN, breakDOWN
- Could ABLE be in something? tABLE, cABLE
- PARAMOUNT... 
- SUBARU...

5. Let me think about stars in logos:
- SUBARU (Pleiades constellation - 6 stars)
- PARAMOUNT (stars around mountain)
- NASA (space/stars related)
- N.F.L. (has stars in logo? The NFL shield has stars)

Actually, let me think more carefully about organizations/companies with STARS in their logos:
- SUBARU - Yes, stars (Pleiades)
- PARAMOUNT - Yes, stars around the mountain
- Could others have stars?

6. Words that can precede or follow "STAR":
- DOWN + STAR? No
- GAME + STAR? No

7. Let me think about the "willing/ready" synonyms again:
DOWN, EAGER, GAME, WILLING, ABLE - all can mean ready/willing to participate
- "I'm down" = willing
- "I'm game" = willing
- "I'm eager" = willing
- "I'm willing" = obvious
- "I'm able" = capable, but also "ready and able"

Actually ABLE is more about capability than willingness. Let me think:
DOWN, EAGER, GAME, WILLING - these four all mean "willing to do something"

Let me try this guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
DOWN, EAGER, GAME, WILLING

DOWN, EAGER, GAME, WILLING were all words meaning "willing to do something."

Remaining words: NASA, N.F.L., EAVE, SUBARU, NOAA, PARAMOUNT, ABLE, CANE

Now I need to find two groups of 4 from these 8 words.

1. Acronyms/Organizations:
- NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)
- N.F.L. (National Football League)
- NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
- Could ABLE be an acronym? Or PARAMOUNT?
- Actually, could these all be organizations with something in common?

2. Hidden words within larger words:
- CANE in hurriCANE
- EAVE in hEAVEn or lEAVE or wEAVE
- ABLE in tABLE, cABLE, stABLE, fABLE
- What about PARAMOUNT, SUBARU, NASA, N.F.L., NOAA?

Let me think about words hidden at the end of other words:
- hurriCANE → CANE
- hEAVEn or wEAVE → EAVE (actually in the middle/end)
- tABLE → ABLE
- What could be the fourth?

3. Stars in logos:
- SUBARU - has stars (Pleiades)
- PARAMOUNT - has stars around mountain
- NASA - space agency, associated with stars
- N.F.L. - does the NFL logo have stars? Yes, I believe it has stars

Let me reconsider the hidden words angle more carefully:
- CANE: hurriCANE
- EAVE: hEAVEn, wEAVE, lEAVEs
- ABLE: tABLE, cABLE, fABLE, stABLE
- Could any of NASA, N.F.L., SUBARU, NOAA, PARAMOUNT have hidden words?

Actually wait - what if these are all hidden in WEATHER-related words?
- hurriCANE (weather)
- What about NOAA? NOAA is weather-related itself...

Let me think about another pattern:
- Organizations with stars in logos: SUBARU, PARAMOUNT, NASA, N.F.L.?
  - SUBARU: 6 stars (Pleiades)
  - PARAMOUNT: Stars around mountain
  - NASA: Space-related
  - N.F.L.: The NFL shield has stars on it

Actually, I'm more confident about the hidden words pattern:
- hurriCANE → CANE
- tABLE → ABLE  
- hEAVEn → EAVE
- Need a fourth...

What about PARAMOUNT? paraMOUNT? No, MOUNT isn't in our list.
SUBARU? suBARu? BAR isn't in our list.
NOAA? No obvious hidden word.
NASA? No obvious hidden word.
N.F.L.? No hidden word.

Hmm, let me think differently. What if the pattern is words that sound like letters or have letter patterns?

Let me go with the stars in logos theory:
NASA, N.F.L., SUBARU, PARAMOUNT - all have stars in their logos</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
NASA, N.F.L., SUBARU, PARAMOUNT

Remaining words: EAVE, NOAA, ABLE, CANE

These must be the final four. Let me verify the connection:
- CANE: hidden in hurriCANE
- EAVE: hidden in hEAVEn or wEAVE
- ABLE: hidden in tABLE, cABLE, fABLE
- NOAA: hidden in... what?

Wait, NOAA... could it be hidden in something? 
- geNOA? No, that's GENOA
- quiNOA! Yes! quiNOA contains NOAA

So these are all words hidden within other common words:
- CANE in hurriCANE
- EAVE in hEAVEn
- ABLE in tABLE
- NOAA in quiNOA

This must be the final category!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me list them out: JAZZ, SPLIT, BLEW, FORECAST, CHORAL, SPIRIT, SHADE, WIGHT, BURST, BROKE, RAP, CALL, DIVINE, SPECTER, READ, AMERICANA

Let me look for potential groupings:

1. **Ghost/Spirit related words**: SPIRIT, SHADE, WIGHT, SPECTER - these are all words that can mean ghost or supernatural being. This seems like a strong connection!

2. **Music genres**: JAZZ, RAP, CHORAL, AMERICANA - these could all be music genres or styles. Jazz music, Rap music, Choral music, Americana (a music genre). This seems plausible!

3. **Words that can follow "PSYCHIC" or relate to fortune telling**: FORECAST, DIVINE, READ, CALL - hmm, let me think... "fortune teller" activities? DIVINE (to divine the future), READ (palm reading, tarot reading), FORECAST (predict), CALL (calling spirits?)

4. **Past tense of "break" or similar words**: BROKE, BURST, SPLIT, BLEW - these could all relate to breaking or past tense verbs? BROKE (past of break), BURST (past of burst), SPLIT (past of split), BLEW (past of blow). Wait, these could also go with "UP" - BROKE UP, BURST UP(?), SPLIT UP, BLEW UP... 

Let me reconsider: Words that can precede or follow a common word?
- SPLIT, BROKE, BURST, BLEW + UP? SPLIT UP, BROKE UP, BLEW UP... BURST UP doesn't work as well.

Actually, let me think about "___ UP":
- SPLIT UP ✓
- BROKE UP ✓
- BLEW UP ✓
- BURST... doesn't quite work with UP

What about things that can be "HANDS"?
- JAZZ HANDS ✓
- SPIRIT... not really

Let me reconsider the ghost synonyms: SPIRIT, SHADE, WIGHT, SPECTER - these all definitely mean ghost/specter/supernatural being. This is my strongest guess.

Let me also consider: ISLE OF ___ (place names with British islands?)
- ISLE OF WIGHT ✓
- ISLE OF... hmm

Actually, looking again at music genres: JAZZ, RAP, CHORAL, AMERICANA - all music styles/genres. This is also strong.

I'll go with the ghost synonyms first as it seems most concrete: SPIRIT, SHADE, WIGHT, SPECTER</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now let me work with the remaining 12 words:

JAZZ, SPLIT, BLEW, FORECAST, CHORAL, BURST, BROKE, RAP, CALL, DIVINE, READ, AMERICANA

Let me reconsider my earlier groupings:

1. **Music genres**: JAZZ, RAP, CHORAL, AMERICANA - these are all music genres/styles. Jazz, Rap, Choral music, Americana (folk/country-influenced genre). This still seems strong.

2. **Words that can follow a common word or relate to fortune telling/predicting**: FORECAST, DIVINE, READ, CALL - Let me think more carefully...
   - DIVINE can mean to predict/foretell
   - READ (as in read palms, read tarot)
   - FORECAST (predict the future)
   - CALL (call it, predict something)
   
   These could all be ways to predict or foretell something!

3. **Past tense verbs / "UP" words**: SPLIT, BLEW, BURST, BROKE
   - SPLIT UP
   - BLEW UP
   - BROKE UP (ended relationship)
   - BURST... burst out? burst up?
   
   Wait, what if these are all words that can precede "OUT"?
   - SPLIT... not really
   - BLEW OUT (candles)
   - BURST OUT (laughing)
   - BROKE OUT (escaped, or broke out in hives)

   Or maybe they can all follow something? Like "WENT ___"? No...

   What about ending a relationship: SPLIT, BROKE (broke up), ... hmm

Let me think about "___ HANDS":
- JAZZ HANDS ✓

What about "COLD ___":
- COLD CALL ✓
- COLD READ ✓
- COLD BURST? No
- COLD FORECAST? No

Actually, COLD + something:
- COLD CALL (sales technique)
- COLD READ (acting/psychic technique)
- COLD...

   - COLD READ ✓ (acting technique where you read a script without preparation, or psychic "cold reading")
   - COLD BURST? No

   - BURST... doesn't work as well
   - BROKE UP ✓

4. **Words that can follow "OUT"**:
   - BURST OUT ✓
   - BROKE OUT ✓
   - BLEW OUT? (like blew out candles, but usually "blew out" not "out blew")

   - STOCK SPLIT ✓
   - STOCK FORECAST ✓
   - STOCK CALL? (options call)
   - STOCK... hmm

What about "___ OPEN"?
   - BURST OPEN ✓
   - BLEW OPEN ✓
   - BROKE OPEN ✓
   - SPLIT OPEN ✓

Available words: FOLLOW, ROGER, WATCH, ROSE, VELVETEEN, TRIX, SQUID, DONUT, PEN, TRACK, TATTOO MACHINE, PRINTER, WHITE, MONITOR, JUROR, MONTH

Let me think about potential categories:

1. Things that use INK:
- SQUID (has ink)
- PEN (uses ink)
- TATTOO MACHINE (uses ink)
- PRINTER (uses ink)
This seems like a strong connection!

2. Famous rabbits:
- ROGER (Roger Rabbit)
- VELVETEEN (Velveteen Rabbit)
- WHITE (White Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland)
- TRIX (Trix rabbit from cereal)
This is another strong connection!

3. Words that can follow "HONEY":
- DONUT (honeydew? no... honey donut?)
- Actually let me think differently

4. Words that can precede or follow another word:
- ROSE could be part of various phrases
- MONTH could be "month of Sundays"

5. Things you can do to someone/something (verbs):
- FOLLOW
- WATCH
- TRACK
- MONITOR
These are all ways to surveil or keep tabs on something!

6. Let me verify my categories:

Category 1 - Things that use/produce INK: SQUID, PEN, TATTOO MACHINE, PRINTER - Yes, this works!

Category 2 - Famous fictional rabbits: ROGER (Rabbit), VELVETEEN (Rabbit), WHITE (Rabbit), TRIX (Rabbit) - Yes!

Category 3 - Surveillance/tracking words: FOLLOW, WATCH, TRACK, MONITOR - These are all verbs meaning to observe or track someone.

That accounts for 12 words. The remaining 4 would be: ROSE, DONUT, JUROR, MONTH

What could connect ROSE, DONUT, JUROR, MONTH?
- Could these all precede or follow a common word?
- ROSE + something: rosebud, rose garden
- DONUT + something: donut hole
- JUROR + something: grand juror
- MONTH + something: month-long

Hmm, what about _____ DUTY?
- JURY DUTY (JUROR... not quite)

What about HUNG ___?
- HUNG JURY (JUROR related)

What about words that can follow "SEQUESTERED"?
- JUROR can be sequestered

Let me think about "HOLE":
- DONUT HOLE
- Could ROSE, JUROR, MONTH have holes?

Actually, what about things that can be "HUNG"?
- HUNG JURY (JUROR)
- ROSE can be hung/dried

Let me reconsider. I'm most confident in the INK category and the RABBIT category.

I'll start with the rabbits since that's a very specific category:
ROGER, VELVETEEN, WHITE, TRIX - all famous rabbits from media/literature.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now let me work with the remaining 12 words:

FOLLOW, WATCH, ROSE, SQUID, DONUT, PEN, TRACK, TATTOO MACHINE, PRINTER, MONITOR, JUROR, MONTH

My previous analysis identified two strong categories:

1. Things that use/produce INK: SQUID, PEN, TATTOO MACHINE, PRINTER
- SQUID produces ink
- PEN uses ink
- TATTOO MACHINE uses ink
- PRINTER uses ink

2. Surveillance/tracking words (verbs): FOLLOW, WATCH, TRACK, MONITOR
- All mean to observe or keep tabs on someone/something

That would leave: ROSE, DONUT, JUROR, MONTH

Let me verify what could connect ROSE, DONUT, JUROR, MONTH:
- Could they all follow a word like "HUNG"?
  - HUNG JURY (related to JUROR)
  - Hmm, not quite working

- Could they precede or follow "GAME"?
  - No...

- What about things that can be "SEQUESTERED"?
  - JUROR can be sequestered
  - Not the others...

- Words that follow "HONEYMOON"?
  - HONEYMOON MONTH? Not really

- What about "____ GAME"?
  - SQUID GAME! Wait, SQUID is in another category

Let me reconsider... Actually, wait:
- SQUID GAME
- ROSE could be part of a game title?
- DONUT... 

Hmm, let me think about SQUID differently. Could SQUID be part of a different category?

Actually, I'm very confident in the INK category. Let me go with that.

SQUID, PEN, TATTOO MACHINE, PRINTER - all use or produce ink.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

My previous analysis identified:

1. Surveillance/tracking words (verbs): FOLLOW, WATCH, TRACK, MONITOR
- All mean to observe or keep tabs on someone/something
- FOLLOW someone
- WATCH someone
- TRACK someone
- MONITOR someone

That would leave: ROSE, DONUT, JUROR, MONTH

What could connect ROSE, DONUT, JUROR, MONTH?

Let me think harder:
- ROSE: flower, past tense of rise, name
- DONUT: pastry with a hole
- JUROR: member of a jury
- MONTH: unit of time

Could they all precede or follow a common word?
- _____ HOLE: DONUT HOLE... 
- What about things that can be "HUNG"?
  - HUNG JURY (so JUROR relates to HUNG)
  - Could others relate to HUNG?

Wait, what about "HONEYMOON ____"?
- HONEYMOON MONTH? HONEYMOON ROSE?

What about things that can follow "JURY"?
- No, JUROR is the person...

Let me think about compound words or phrases:
- ROSE + BUD, BOWL, GARDEN, WATER
- DONUT + HOLE, SHOP
- JUROR + ?
- MONTH + LY, END

What if they all can follow the same word?
- HONEY: HONEYMOON (MONTH?), no...

What about "HUNG"?
- HUNG JURY → JUROR connection
- HUNG... anything else?

Actually, what about words that can follow "TO-DO" or similar?
- No...

Let me think about "SEQUESTERED":
- SEQUESTERED JUROR? A juror can be sequestered

What about TRIAL?
- TRIAL MONTH (free trial month)
- Could there be trial versions of other things?

Hmm, let me go with my confident category first - the surveillance words:

Now I need to figure out what connects these four words. Let me think:

- ROSE: flower, past tense of rise, name (like Rose from Titanic)
- DONUT: pastry with a hole
- JUROR: member of a jury
- MONTH: unit of time

What could they all have in common?

Could they all follow or precede a word?

What about "HUNG"?
- HUNG JURY (JUROR is part of a jury that could be hung)
- HUNG... ROSE? Not common
- HUNG DONUT? No
- HUNG MONTH? No

What about things that can be "SEQUESTERED"?
- A JUROR can be sequestered
- Hmm...

What about "HONEYMOON"?
- HONEYMOON period/MONTH? 
- Not the others...

What about words that can come after a number?
- 12 JUROR? (12 Angry Men had jurors)
- MONTH can follow numbers (6-month)
- ROSE? 
- DONUT?

Wait! What about things associated with specific numbers?
- 12 = dozen = DONUT (dozen donuts)
- 12 = jurors on a jury
- 12 = months in a year
- 12 = roses in a dozen?

Could they all be things commonly sold/counted in DOZENS or associated with 12?
- DOZEN DONUTS
- DOZEN ROSES
- 12 JURORS
- 12 MONTHS

Yes! This makes sense - they're all things associated with the number 12 or a dozen!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me list them out: TILE, CARPET, PIP, SHORE, WAILER, STRAND, LAMINATE, CHEMISTRY, BANSHEE, HEARTBREAKER, COAST, BANK, FIREWORKS, WOOD, SPARK, CONNECTION

Let me look for potential categories:

1. Flooring types: TILE, CARPET, LAMINATE, WOOD - these are all types of flooring! This seems like a strong connection.

2. Words related to beach/water edge: SHORE, STRAND, COAST, BANK - these could all describe the edge of a body of water. STRAND can mean a beach, SHORE is the edge of water, COAST is the shoreline, BANK is the edge of a river.

3. Things that scream/wail: WAILER, BANSHEE - these both relate to screaming/wailing, but I need 4 words.

4. Words that can follow "HEART": HEARTBREAKER is one word... but could there be patterns like ___ BREAKER? HEARTBREAKER, could BANSHEE relate? No...

5. Let me think about "PIP" - this could be a seed, a dot on dice/cards, or a character from Great Expectations.

6. CHEMISTRY, FIREWORKS, SPARK, CONNECTION - these could all relate to romantic attraction/relationships! "We have chemistry," "there were fireworks," "a spark between us," "we have a connection" - these are all ways to describe romantic attraction!

7. WAILER, BANSHEE, HEARTBREAKER - could these be types of something? Or names?

Let me reconsider:
- BOB MARLEY and the WAILERS - music related?
- PIP could be Gladys Knight and the Pips
- Could there be a pattern with "_____ and the _____"?

Actually, thinking about bands/musicians:
- WAILER - Bob Marley and the Wailers
- PIP - Gladys Knight and the Pips
- BANSHEE - Siouxsie and the Banshees
- HEARTBREAKER - Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers

This seems like a strong category! "___ and the ___S" - famous bands!

Let me verify my categories:
1. Flooring: TILE, CARPET, LAMINATE, WOOD ✓
2. Edge of water: SHORE, STRAND, COAST, BANK ✓
3. Romantic attraction metaphors: CHEMISTRY, FIREWORKS, SPARK, CONNECTION ✓

2. Words related to keeping a promise or commitment:

These all mean to maintain or follow through on something.

3. Card game actions:

These are all actions in card games like Uno.

4. Types of bed coverings or related words:

Wait, THROW was used in the bedding category, so let me recheck the remaining words:

HONOR, DRAW, UPHOLD, PLAY, DISCARD, FULFILL, KEEP, PASS

That's 8 words, which should form 2 categories of 4.

1. Promise-related verbs (to maintain a commitment):
- UPHOLD (uphold a promise/oath)
- FULFILL (fulfill a promise/obligation)
- KEEP (keep a promise)
- HONOR (honor a commitment/agreement)
These all mean to follow through on or maintain a commitment.

2. Card game actions:
- DRAW (draw a card)
- DISCARD (discard a card)
- PASS (pass your turn)
- PLAY (play a card)
These are all actions in card games like Uno.

Both categories fit perfectly. I'll go with the promise-related verbs next.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Available words: DROP, SAILOR, APOLLO, PARROT, MIME, FANTASTIC, LAG, FREEZE, CANDLES, MONKEY, ECHO, PRISONER, GENIE, REFEREE, SAMURAI, PRINCESS

Let me think about potential categories:

1. **Mr. ___** (words that follow "Mr."):
   - Mr. Fantastic (from Fantastic Four)
   - Mr. Freeze (Batman villain)
   - Mr. Echo (Lost character? Or Amazon Echo?)
   - Wait, let me think more...

2. **Words that can follow "MR."**:
   - FANTASTIC → Mr. Fantastic
   - FREEZE → Mr. Freeze
   - MIME → Mr. Mime (Pokémon!)
   - Could there be others?

3. **Amazon products/devices**:
   - ECHO (Amazon Echo)
   - KINDLE? No, but CANDLES is close...
   - APOLLO? No...

4. **Pokémon**:
   - Mr. Mime is a Pokémon
   - Wait, what about other connections?

5. **Words that can follow a common word**:
   - SAILOR MOON? SAILOR could be part of something
   - PRINCESS → Disney Princess
   - GENIE → Aladdin's Genie
   - MONKEY → various contexts

6. **___ BAR** (types of bars):
   - MONKEY bar
   - CANDLE bar? No...
   - Let me think differently

   - PRINCESS? No...

8. **"The ___ of Zenda"** or similar titles:
   - PRISONER of Zenda

9. **Let me reconsider "___ MOON"**:
   - SAILOR Moon (anime)
   - What else?

10. **Words that follow "SPACE"**:
    - MONKEY → Space Monkey?
    
11. **"Mic ___"** or similar:

15. **Actually, let me think about "MR." again**:
    - Mr. Mime
    - Mr. Freeze
    - Mr. Fantastic
    - Mr. Apollo? No...

16. **What about APOLLO**:
    - Apollo 13
    - Apollo Creed (Rocky)
    - Greek god

17. **Let me think about Disney**:
    - GENIE (Aladdin)
    - PRINCESS
    - Could there be Disney references?

18. **"Seven ___" (Magnificent Seven, Seven Samurai, etc.)**:
    - SAMURAI → Seven Samurai

19. **___ BARS**:
    - MONKEY bars
    - CANDLE bars? No
    - PARALLEL bars? No, PARROT doesn't fit

20. **Let me reconsider "Mr. ___"**:
    - Mr. Mime (Pokémon)
    - Mr. Freeze (Batman villain)  
    - Mr. Fantastic (Fantastic Four)
    - Mr. Referee? No...

Actually, looking at this more carefully:
- MIME → Mr. Mime
- FREEZE → Mr. Freeze
- What about APOLLO → Apollo (Greek god, not Mr.)

Let me think about **BIRTHDAY PARTY items or themes**:
- CANDLES (birthday candles)
- PRINCESS (princess party theme)
- MIME (party entertainment)
- GENIE? 

Hmm, what about **___ SUIT**:
- SAILOR suit
- MONKEY suit
- No...

Let me focus on **Mr. ___**:
- MIME, FREEZE, FANTASTIC... what's the 4th?
- Mr. Referee? Mr. Samurai? Mr. Prisoner? These don't work.

Actually, I'm fairly confident about Mr. Mime, Mr. Freeze, and Mr. Fantastic. Let me search for the 4th...
- Mr. Echo? That was a character in Lost!

So: MIME, FREEZE, FANTASTIC, ECHO could all follow "Mr."</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me reconsider.

I was confident about Mr. Mime, Mr. Freeze, and Mr. Fantastic. Maybe ECHO wasn't right, or maybe I had the wrong category entirely.

Let me look at other patterns:

Available words: DROP, SAILOR, APOLLO, PARROT, MIME, FANTASTIC, LAG, FREEZE, CANDLES, MONKEY, ECHO, PRISONER, GENIE, REFEREE, SAMURAI, PRINCESS

**"Sixteen ___" or specific number patterns**:
- CANDLES → Sixteen Candles (movie)
- What else could be "Sixteen ___"?

**Words that can follow a number**:
- SAMURAI → Seven Samurai
- CANDLES → Sixteen Candles
- PRINCESS → ? 
- APOLLO → Apollo 13

**Actually, let me think about movies with numbers**:
- Seven Samurai
- Sixteen Candles
- Apollo 13
- Fantastic Four? No, that's "Four" at the end...

**Wait - what about ___ 13 or Apollo ___**:
- APOLLO 13
- FRIDAY the 13th? No FRIDAY here...

**Let me think about "____ Four"** or **"Four ____"**:
- Fantastic Four
- Gang of Four?

**What about words that follow "SPACE"**:
- MONKEY → Space Monkey (Fight Club reference)

**Amazon devices**:
- ECHO → Amazon Echo

**Let me think about "BIRTHDAY" theme**:
- CANDLES, PRINCESS (party theme)...

**What about fashion/clothing items - ___ SUIT**:
- SAILOR suit
- MONKEY suit (tuxedo)
- Let me think more...

**Words that can precede "BUSINESS"**:
- MONKEY business
- SHOW business? No SHOW...

**"Bars" theme**:
- MONKEY bars
- PARALLEL bars... no PARALLEL

**Let me reconsider the "MR." category** - maybe it's not ECHO:
- Mr. Mime
- Mr. Freeze  
- Mr. Fantastic
- What else? Mr. Referee? Mr. T? 

**Words associated with TV shows/characters**:
- ECHO → could be from Lost or Daredevil
- REFEREE
- GENIE → I Dream of Jeannie

**What about "SEE/HEAR/SPEAK NO EVIL" monkeys theme?**:
- MONKEY is there but...

**Let me think about PARROT**:
- Pirate's parrot
- Parrot fashion
- Polly the parrot

**SAILOR**:
- Sailor Moon
- Sailor suit
- Popeye the Sailor

**Actually, what about "____ MOON"**:
- SAILOR Moon
- HARVEST Moon? No HARVEST
- FULL Moon? No FULL

**Let me reconsider - words that can follow "BODY"**:
- FREEZE → Body freeze? No...

**What about "___ LAMP"**:
- GENIE lamp (or lamp with genie)
- LAVA lamp? No LAVA

**"___ BAR"** again:
- MONKEY bar
- Let me see what else...

**Thinking about arcade games or actions**:
- FREEZE
- DROP
- LAG

**What about internet/gaming terms**:
- LAG (connection lag)
- DROP (frame drop, connection drop)
- FREEZE (game freeze)
- ECHO (audio echo)

Let me try this: LAG, DROP, FREEZE, ECHO - all could be computer/connection issues!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now let me look at the remaining 12 words:
SAILOR, APOLLO, PARROT, MIME, FANTASTIC, CANDLES, MONKEY, PRISONER, GENIE, REFEREE, SAMURAI, PRINCESS

Let me reconsider my earlier theories:

**"Mr. ___" category**:
- MIME → Mr. Mime (Pokémon)
- FANTASTIC → Mr. Fantastic (Marvel)
- FREEZE was correct for the other category, so not this

Let me think about other "Mr." options:
- Mr. Mime
- Mr. Fantastic
- Mr. Referee? No...
- Mr. Samurai? No...

**What about movies with numbers in titles**:
- SAMURAI → Seven Samurai
- CANDLES → Sixteen Candles
- APOLLO → Apollo 13
- PRINCESS → The Princess Diaries? No number... Princess Bride? No...
- MONKEY → 12 Monkeys!

So: SAMURAI (Seven), CANDLES (Sixteen), APOLLO (13), MONKEY (12) - all movies with numbers!

Let me verify:
- Seven Samurai ✓
- Sixteen Candles ✓
- Apollo 13 ✓
- 12 Monkeys ✓

This seems very strong!

Other remaining words would be: SAILOR, PARROT, MIME, FANTASTIC, PRISONER, GENIE, REFEREE, PRINCESS

Let me also check other potential groupings for remaining words:
- SAILOR → Sailor Moon
- PRINCESS → Princess Mononoke? Or Disney Princess
- GENIE → Aladdin
- PARROT → ?

**What about "_____ MOON" anime/shows**:
- SAILOR Moon

**Disney characters**:
- GENIE (Aladdin)
- PRINCESS (various)

I'm most confident about the movies with numbers category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: SAILOR, APOLLO, PARROT, MIME, FANTASTIC, CANDLES, MONKEY, PRISONER, GENIE, REFEREE, SAMURAI, PRINCESS

Maybe only some of those are correct, or it's a different pattern entirely.

Let me think about other groupings:

**What can follow "FASHION"**:
- PARROT fashion (to repeat like a parrot)
- No, that doesn't work well

**"___ PRINCESS" or "PRINCESS ___"**:
- Princess Bride
- Princess Mononoke

**Let me think about Studio Ghibli films**:
- PRINCESS Mononoke
- Could others fit?

**What about words that can follow "FAIRY"**:
- PRINCESS? Fairy Princess?
- No...

**Let me think about costumes or party themes**:
- PRINCESS costume
- GENIE costume
- SAILOR costume
- MIME costume
- REFEREE costume
- SAMURAI costume
- PRISONER costume

These could all be Halloween costumes!

**Actually, what about "KISS" - the band members**:
- They have different personas/costumes

**What about things you might see at a children's birthday party (entertainment)**:
- MIME
- PRINCESS
- GENIE (magician)

**Let me think about "_____ BARS"**:
- MONKEY bars
- PARALLEL bars (no PARALLEL)
- CANDLE bars? No...

**What about Britney Spears or music videos**:
- "Oops I Did It Again" - red suit
- No clear connection

**Let me think about words that follow "SPACE"**:
- MONKEY → Space Monkey

**What about compound words or phrases with a common word**:

**"SEA ___"**:
- MONKEY → Sea Monkey!
- What else?

**"___ SUIT"**:
- MONKEY suit (tuxedo)
- SAILOR suit
- Could there be others?

**"_____ WRESTLING"**:
- No clear fit

**What about "Barrel of ___"**:
- MONKEY → Barrel of Monkeys

**Let me reconsider - words associated with Aladdin**:
- GENIE
- PRINCESS (Jasmine)
- MONKEY (Abu)
- PARROT (Iago)

This could be it! Aladdin characters:
- GENIE
- PRINCESS (Jasmine)
- MONKEY (Abu the monkey)

Now I have 8 words left:
SAILOR, APOLLO, MIME, FANTASTIC, CANDLES, PRISONER, REFEREE, SAMURAI

I need to find two groups of 4.

Let me think about possible categories:

**"Mr. ___" category**:
- MIME → Mr. Mime (Pokémon)
- FANTASTIC → Mr. Fantastic (Marvel)
- What else? Mr. Referee? No... Mr. Samurai? No...

**Movies with numbers**:
- SAMURAI → Seven Samurai
- CANDLES → Sixteen Candles
- APOLLO → Apollo 13
- PRISONER → The Prisoner? Not a number...

Hmm, let me think differently.

**What about "THE ___" (famous works/titles)**:
- THE PRISONER (TV show)
- THE REFEREE?

**What about words that follow a specific word**:

**"___ MOON"**:
- SAILOR Moon (anime)

**Could these all be anime or Japanese media**:
- SAILOR (Sailor Moon)
- SAMURAI (various samurai anime)
- PRISONER?

**What about "JERRY ___" or "___ JERRY"**:
- No clear fit

**"FANCY ___"**:
- FANCY CANDLES? No...

**What about boxing/sports**:
- APOLLO (Apollo Creed from Rocky)
- REFEREE

**Rocky movie characters**:
- APOLLO Creed
- Could others fit?

**What about things that can be "BIRTHDAY ___"**:
- CANDLES → Birthday candles

**Let me think about "___ CREED"**:
- APOLLO Creed
- ASSASSIN'S Creed? No ASSASSIN

**What about "IRON ___"**:
- IRON MIME? No
- IRON CHEF? No CHEF

**"___ JERRY" (Tom and Jerry? Or other)**:

**What about words that follow "CELL" or "PRISON"**:
- PRISONER

**Let me think systematically about what word could precede all of them**:

**"___ SUIT"**:
- SAILOR suit ✓
- Could others work?

**What about "FRENCH ___"**:
- MIME → French mime? (mimes are associated with France)
- CANDLES → French candles? No...

**What about words that can follow "PROFESSIONAL"**:
- REFEREE
- Not really others...

**Let me try numbers again more carefully**:
- Seven SAMURAI
- Sixteen CANDLES  
- Apollo 13... APOLLO
- PRISONER → The Prisoner (Number 6)? Or Cell Block something?

Wait! What about "NUMBER ___" or things associated with numbers:
- THE PRISONER - the main character is "Number 6"
- FANTASTIC - Fantastic Four (4)
- APOLLO - Apollo 13 (13)
- Could SAMURAI be Seven Samurai (7)?
- CANDLES - Sixteen Candles (16)?

Actually, let me try: FANTASTIC, APOLLO, SAMURAI, CANDLES - if they all have numbers associated:
- Fantastic FOUR
- Apollo THIRTEEN  
- Seven SAMURAI
- Sixteen CANDLES

But wait - FANTASTIC comes before the number, others come after. Let me reconsider.

Maybe the category is "Movie titles with numbers" where the word is adjacent to the number:
- APOLLO 13
- Seven SAMURAI
- Sixteen CANDLES
- 12 MONKEYS was already used...

What about PRISONER? Is there a movie like "Prisoner 13" or something?
- "The Prisoner" TV show features Number 6
- Cell 211? No...

Let me try: APOLLO, SAMURAI, CANDLES, and... FANTASTIC (Fantastic Four)?

Actually, FANTASTIC Four has the number after, while the others have the number before/after the word. This might still work if the category is just "titles with numbers."

Let me go with APOLLO, SAMURAI, CANDLES, FANTASTIC as movies/shows with numbers.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

SAILOR, MIME, PRISONER, REFEREE

These must form the last category. Let me think about what connects them:

- SAILOR
- MIME
- PRISONER

What could connect these?

**"French ___"**:
- French MIME? Mimes are French-associated
- French SAILOR? Not really

**Costumes/uniforms**:

**"___ SUIT"**:
- SAILOR suit? Yes
- MIME suit? Not really

**What about striped clothing**:

- REFEREE - striped shirt
- MIME - often wears stripes
- SAILOR - sailor shirts can have stripes!

Yes! They all are associated with BLACK AND WHITE STRIPES:
- SAILOR - sailor shirts with horizontal stripes
- MIME - classic mime outfit with stripes
- PRISONER - black and white striped prison uniform
- REFEREE - black and white striped shirt

4. **Map/Navigation related**: COMPASS, SCALE, KEY (map key), INSET (inset map) - these are all things you'd find on a map!

5. **Words that can follow "OUT"**: BEAT (outbeat?), BEST (outbest?), DOOR (outdoor), GATE (outgate?)... maybe not perfect.

6. **Superlatives or comparisons**: BEST, BETTER, TOP... need a fourth.

7. **Words that can follow a word**: Let me think about what can come before these...
   - "OUT___": DOOR (outdoor?), BEAT (outbeat)... 
   - "___MAP" components: COMPASS, SCALE, KEY, INSET

Let me reconsider:

**Map components**: COMPASS, SCALE, KEY, INSET - A map has a compass rose, a scale bar, a key/legend, and often an inset map. This seems very strong!

**___ Street**: DOWNING, FLEET, WALL, MAIN - All famous streets or common street names.

**Entrances**: DOOR, GATE, HATCH, PORTAL - All ways to enter/exit.

**Remaining words**: BEST, BEAT, TOP, BETTER - What connects these?
- BEAT could be "top" as in "beat" meaning to surpass
- BEST, BETTER, TOP... these are all ways to say "surpass" or "exceed"
- Actually: BEST, BEAT, TOP, BETTER - can all mean to "surpass" or "outdo" someone!

Let me start with what I'm most confident about - the map components seem very specific and clear.

Actually, wait - let me reconsider BEAT. "Beat" can mean to surpass (as in "beat the competition"), but it's also less obvious than BEST, BETTER, TOP.

I'll go with the map components first as it seems most concrete: COMPASS, SCALE, KEY, INSET</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
COMPASS, SCALE, KEY, INSET

Now let me look at the remaining 12 words:

DOOR, DOWNING, BEST, BEAT, GATE, WALL, FLEET, TOP, HATCH, BETTER, PORTAL, MAIN

Let me reconsider my earlier groupings:

1. **___ Street**: DOWNING (Downing Street), FLEET (Fleet Street), WALL (Wall Street), MAIN (Main Street) - These all precede "Street" to make famous/common street names.

2. **Entrances/Portals**: DOOR, GATE, HATCH, PORTAL - All ways to enter or exit something.

3. **Words meaning "surpass/outdo"**: BEST, BEAT, TOP, BETTER - All can mean to surpass or exceed someone/something. "I can best you," "I can beat you," "I can top that," "I can better that."

Let me verify these groupings work with the remaining 12 words:
- DOWNING, FLEET, WALL, MAIN (4 words) - Streets
- DOOR, GATE, HATCH, PORTAL (4 words) - Entrances
- BEST, BEAT, TOP, BETTER (4 words) - Surpass/exceed

That's exactly 12 words in 3 groups of 4. Perfect!

2. **Words meaning "surpass/outdo"**: BEST, BEAT, TOP, BETTER - All can be verbs meaning to surpass or exceed someone/something.

Let me verify:
- DOOR, GATE, HATCH, PORTAL - Yes, these are all types of entrances/openings
- BEST (verb: "I bested him"), BEAT ("I beat him"), TOP ("I topped his score"), BETTER ("I bettered my record") - Yes, all can mean to surpass

Let me look for patterns:

1. Words that can follow "SMALL":
- SMALL TALK ✓
- SMALL POTATO ✓
- SMALL BRAIN? (not really a phrase)
- SMALL PICTURE? (not common)

2. Words related to movies/cinema:
- FLICK (slang for movie)
- PICTURE (old term for movie)
- FILM (movie)
- FEATURE (as in feature film)
This looks promising! All four can mean "movie"

3. Things that are wrinkled:
- PRUNE (wrinkled fruit)

- CREPE PAPER (wrinkled paper)
This also looks very promising!

4. Words related to spreading/distributing:

5. Checking "SWEET ___":

- SWEET TOOTH ✓
- SWEET POTATO ✓

This is a very strong pattern! All four work with "SWEET" before them.

Let me verify:
- SWEET SIXTEEN (birthday)
- SWEET TOOTH (craving for sweets)
- SWEET POTATO (vegetable)
- SWEET TALK (flattery)

Remaining words: FLICK, PICTURE, LITTER, FILM, PRUNE, SPRINKLE, BRAIN, SCATTER, PEPPER, SHAR PEI, FEATURE, CREPE PAPER

Let me revisit my earlier analysis:

1. Words meaning "movie":
- FLICK (slang for movie)
- PICTURE (old term for movie)
- FILM (movie)
- FEATURE (as in feature film)
This still looks very strong!

2. Wrinkled things:

3. Verbs meaning to spread/distribute:

First, let me list them out: FIDDLE, MICROWAVE, STOVETOP, POPPER, WARM, KETTLE, SWEET, TRIFLE, FLIPPER, TENDER, FRITTER, FIN, WING, THROW, ARM, KIND

Let me think about potential groupings:

1. **Ways to make popcorn**: MICROWAVE, STOVETOP, KETTLE, POPPER - these all relate to methods of making popcorn! Microwave popcorn, stovetop popcorn, kettle corn, and popper (like a popcorn popper). This seems strong!

2. **Body parts of sea creatures/animals**: FIN, FLIPPER, WING, ARM - these could be appendages. But WING is for birds... Let me think more.

3. **Words that can follow "CORN"**: POPPER (corn popper), FRITTER (corn fritter)... hmm, not sure about others.

4. **Words meaning "small amount" or "waste time"**: FIDDLE, TRIFLE - both can mean to waste time or deal with something trivial. FRITTER can mean to waste (fritter away).

5. **Legal tender related**: TENDER - legal tender... 

6. **Words that can precede "CORN"**: Let me check - POPPER (popcorn popper), KETTLE (kettle corn)... 

Wait, let me reconsider the popcorn angle:
- KETTLE corn
- MICROWAVE popcorn
- STOVETOP popcorn  
- AIR POPPER for popcorn

Actually, these might all be types/methods of popcorn preparation.

7. **Words meaning "kind/gentle"**: WARM, SWEET, KIND, TENDER - these all describe personality traits or feelings! This seems very strong.

8. **Dolphin body part**: FLIPPER is a dolphin name/show, FIN...

9. **Money slang**: FIN (5 dollars), TENDER (legal tender)...

10. **Chicken parts**: WING, TENDER (chicken tender), FRITTER (chicken fritter?)

Let me reconsider:
- WARM, SWEET, KIND, TENDER - all adjectives meaning gentle/pleasant
- FIDDLE, TRIFLE, FRITTER - words meaning to waste time (fiddle around, trifle with, fritter away)
- FIN, FLIPPER, WING, ARM - appendages/limbs

Actually for the "waste" meaning: FIDDLE (fiddle around), TRIFLE (trifle with), FRITTER (fritter away)... what's the 4th? THROW (throw away)?

Let me think about POPCORN types again:
- KETTLE corn
- MICROWAVE popcorn
- STOVETOP popcorn
- AIR-POPPED... POPPER?

I'm most confident in WARM, SWEET, KIND, TENDER as words meaning gentle/caring.

Wait - could these go with something else?
- SWEET potato
- WARM... 
- KIND...

Let me also consider: Words that can follow a body part?
- ARM + something
- LEG + something

Actually, let me think about ___ POTATO:
- SWEET potato
- Could others work?

I think my strongest guess is WARM, SWEET, KIND, TENDER as synonyms for gentle/affectionate.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now let me look at the remaining 12 words:
FIDDLE, MICROWAVE, STOVETOP, POPPER, KETTLE, TRIFLE, FLIPPER, FRITTER, FIN, WING, THROW, ARM

Let me reconsider my earlier groupings:

1. **Popcorn methods**: MICROWAVE, STOVETOP, KETTLE, POPPER - these all relate to ways of making popcorn (microwave popcorn, stovetop popcorn, kettle corn, air popper). This still seems very strong!

2. **Words meaning to waste/squander**: FIDDLE (fiddle around), TRIFLE (trifle with), FRITTER (fritter away)... need a 4th. THROW (throw away)? That could work!

3. **Appendages/body parts**: FIN, FLIPPER, WING, ARM - these are all limbs or appendages on different creatures.

4. **Money slang**: FIN (slang for $5), ... not sure about others.

5. **Dolphin related**: FLIPPER (the show/dolphin name), FIN...

Let me verify the popcorn connection:
- MICROWAVE popcorn ✓
- STOVETOP popcorn ✓
- KETTLE corn ✓
- POPPER (popcorn popper) ✓

This seems like a very solid category. Let me go with this.

Actually wait - let me think about "_____ CORN":
- KETTLE corn
- POP corn (POPPER?)
- Actually POPPER might not fit this pattern exactly

But as methods/types of popcorn preparation, these all work together.

I'm going to guess the popcorn-related words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining 8 words:
FIDDLE, TRIFLE, FLIPPER, FRITTER, FIN, WING, THROW, ARM

Let me analyze these:

1. **Words meaning to waste/squander time or resources**: 
- FIDDLE (fiddle around/with)
- TRIFLE (trifle with)
- FRITTER (fritter away)
- Need a 4th... Could THROW work? (throw away)

2. **Appendages/body parts**:
- FIN (fish fin)
- FLIPPER (dolphin/seal flipper)
- WING (bird wing)
- ARM (human arm)

These are all limbs/appendages used for movement or swimming/flying.

3. **Words that can follow a word**:
- Could these all follow "PINBALL"? PINBALL... no
- Could these follow something else?

4. **Slang for money**:
- FIN = $5 slang
- Not sure about others

Let me think more carefully:

Could FIN, FLIPPER, WING, ARM all be appendages? Yes, they all are limbs/appendages on different creatures. This seems solid.

That would leave FIDDLE, TRIFLE, FRITTER, THROW as the other group.
- FIDDLE away (waste time)
- TRIFLE with (treat without seriousness)
- FRITTER away (waste)
- THROW away (discard/waste)

Actually, I think the pattern might be "_____ AWAY":
- FIDDLE away? (not common)
- TRIFLE... doesn't really go with away
- FRITTER away ✓
- THROW away ✓

Hmm, that doesn't quite work.

Let me reconsider. What if they all can precede or follow a common word?

Could they all go with something else?
- ARM + something (ARMCHAIR?)
- WING + something (WINGMAN?)

Wait - could these be "_____ CHAIR"?
- ARM chair ✓
- WING chair ✓ (a type of chair!)
- Hmm, FIN chair? FLIPPER chair? No.

What about body parts that can be "PINBALL" machine parts? Probably not.

Let me think about the appendages again: FIN, FLIPPER, WING, ARM - these are all appendages used for propulsion/movement in different creatures. I'm fairly confident in this grouping.

I'll guess the appendages category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining 4 words:
FIDDLE, TRIFLE, FLIPPER, FRITTER, THROW

Wait, that's 5 words. Let me recount.

Actually, FLIPPER was in my last guess, so the remaining words should be:
FIDDLE, TRIFLE, FRITTER, THROW

That's exactly 4 words - perfect!

These must be the final category. Let me verify the connection:

- FIDDLE (fiddle around/with - to waste time or mess with something)
- TRIFLE (trifle with - to treat without seriousness, to waste)
- FRITTER (fritter away - to waste resources or time)
- THROW (throw away - to discard/waste)

The common thread seems to be words that can mean "to waste" or "to not take seriously" - possibly all can be followed by "AWAY" or have a meaning related to wasting/squandering:

- FRITTER away ✓
- THROW away ✓
- FIDDLE away (less common but exists)
- TRIFLE away? (not as common)

Or maybe they all mean "to waste time" or "to mess around with":
- FIDDLE with/around
- TRIFLE with
- FRITTER away
- THROW... away?

Since these are the only 4 remaining, this must be the answer!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me identify what each word could relate to:

1. AREAL - relating to area
2. VOLUMETRIC - relating to volume
3. ROUNDOFF - a gymnastics move (round-off)
4. ARIAL - a font
5. AERIAL - relating to air, or a gymnastics move
6. SPLIT - a gymnastics move, or to divide
7. MERIDA - Disney princess from Brave
8. ANGULAR - relating to angles
9. IMPACT - a font, or collision
10. AURORA - Disney princess from Sleeping Beauty
11. LINEAR - relating to lines
12. ARABESQUE - a gymnastics/ballet move
13. ARIEL - Disney princess from The Little Mermaid
14. TIANA - Disney princess from The Princess and the Frog
15. VERDANA - a font
16. GEORGIA - a font, or a state/country

Potential categories I see:

**Disney Princesses:**
MERIDA, AURORA, ARIEL, TIANA - These are all Disney princesses!

**Fonts:**
ARIAL, IMPACT, VERDANA, GEORGIA - These are all common computer fonts

**Gymnastics moves:**
ROUNDOFF, AERIAL, SPLIT, ARABESQUE - These could all be gymnastics moves

**Types of measurements/mathematical terms:**
AREAL, VOLUMETRIC, ANGULAR, LINEAR - These all relate to types of measurements or mathematical concepts

Let me verify:
- Disney Princesses: MERIDA (Brave), AURORA (Sleeping Beauty), ARIEL (Little Mermaid), TIANA (Princess and the Frog) ✓
- Fonts: ARIAL, IMPACT, VERDANA, GEORGIA ✓
- Gymnastics: ROUNDOFF, AERIAL, SPLIT, ARABESQUE ✓
- Measurement types: AREAL, VOLUMETRIC, ANGULAR, LINEAR ✓

This seems to fit perfectly! All 16 words are accounted for in 4 categories of 4.

I'm most confident about the Disney Princesses category since those are very specific proper nouns that clearly belong together.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

My previous analysis identified these categories:

**Fonts:**
ARIAL, IMPACT, VERDANA, GEORGIA - These are all common computer fonts (Arial, Impact, Verdana, Georgia)

**Gymnastics moves:**
ROUNDOFF, AERIAL, SPLIT, ARABESQUE - These are all gymnastics/acrobatic moves

**Types of measurements/mathematical terms:**
AREAL, VOLUMETRIC, ANGULAR, LINEAR - These all relate to types of measurements (areal = relating to area, volumetric = relating to volume, angular = relating to angles, linear = relating to lines)

I'm very confident about the fonts category - Arial, Impact, Verdana, and Georgia are all well-known fonts that come standard on most computers.

These should all be types of measurements or mathematical/scientific terms:

These could all be types of measurements, or they might share a common pattern like "___ velocity" or "___ momentum" or something similar in physics.

Actually, thinking about it more:
- Linear velocity/momentum
- Angular velocity/momentum
- Areal velocity (in orbital mechanics)
- Volumetric... flow rate?

Or they could all precede a common word. Let me think... these could all be types of "expansion" or "analysis" or something similar.

First, let me look for obvious patterns:

1. Words ending in "-ING": SWEARING, STIRRING, EARRING, HERRING
   - These all end in "-ING" but that seems too surface-level

2. Words related to cursing/bad language: PROFANITY, SWEARING, EXPLETIVES, FOUR-LETTER WORDS
   - These are all synonyms for curse words/bad language!

3. Words that could follow "RED": RED HERRING, RED HOUSE (not common), RED MYSTERY (no)
   - Maybe not this pattern

4. Let me think about "'Twas the Night Before Christmas" poem:
   - "Not a creature was STIRRING, not even a MOUSE"
   - "HOUSE" appears in the poem
   - Looking for a fourth... this could be a category

5. Words that could be types of something or have a common word:
   - EARRING, NECKLACE - jewelry
   - MESH SHIRT, PLEATHER VEST - clothing items
   
6. Looking at OUROBOROS - a snake eating its own tail, circular symbol
   - MYSTERY, CHRISTMAS, HOUSE... could these go with something?

7. Let me reconsider the Christmas poem angle:
   - "Twas the night before CHRISTMAS"
   - "all through the HOUSE"
   - "not even a MOUSE"
   - "not a creature was STIRRING"
   These four words appear in "'Twas the Night Before Christmas"!

8. The profanity synonyms seem very strong: PROFANITY, SWEARING, EXPLETIVES, FOUR-LETTER WORDS

Let me start with the most confident guess - the synonyms for curse words:
PROFANITY, SWEARING, EXPLETIVES, FOUR-LETTER WORDS

This seems like the strongest connection as they're all direct synonyms.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
PROFANITY, SWEARING, EXPLETIVES, FOUR-LETTER WORDS

Now let me work with the remaining words:
MESH SHIRT, NECKLACE, HOUSE, MOUSE, STIRRING, MYSTERY, EARRING, HERRING, PLEATHER VEST, CHRISTMAS, OUROBOROS, HISTAMINE

Let me reconsider my earlier analysis:

1. "'Twas the Night Before Christmas" poem connection:
   - "Twas the night before CHRISTMAS"
   - "all through the HOUSE"
   - "not even a MOUSE"
   - "not a creature was STIRRING"
   This still seems very strong!

2. Words ending in "-ING": STIRRING, EARRING, HERRING
   - Only 3 words now, so this isn't a complete category

3. Jewelry: NECKLACE, EARRING
   - Only 2, not enough

4. Clothing: MESH SHIRT, PLEATHER VEST
   - Only 2, not enough

5. Let me think about other patterns:
   - OUROBOROS - circular snake symbol
   - HISTAMINE - chemical compound related to allergies
   - MYSTERY - could be a genre, or "MYSTERY" something
   
6. Could there be a "_____ RING" pattern?
   - EARRING (EAR + RING)
   - HERRING (HER + RING? No, that's not right - it's a fish)
   
7. Wait - things that contain hidden words or sounds?
   - EARRING contains EAR
   - HERRING contains... HER? RING?
   - OUROBOROS contains... 
   
8. Let me think about what could connect MESH SHIRT, PLEATHER VEST, NECKLACE, and something else - maybe items worn at a certain type of event/party?

9. Going back to the Christmas poem - this seems like my strongest guess:
   CHRISTMAS, HOUSE, MOUSE, STIRRING

Let me go with this.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now I have 8 words remaining:
MESH SHIRT, NECKLACE, MYSTERY, EARRING, HERRING, PLEATHER VEST, OUROBOROS, HISTAMINE

Let me look for patterns:

1. Words containing hidden words or "RING":
   - EARRING contains "RING"
   - HERRING contains "RING"
   - Could others contain RING? 
   - OUROBOROS - no
   - HISTAMINE - no

2. Let me think about what could go with EARRING and HERRING:
   - Words that sound like or contain other words?
   - RED HERRING is a phrase meaning a misleading clue
   
3. Things you might wear: MESH SHIRT, NECKLACE, EARRING, PLEATHER VEST
   - These are all items you can wear!
   - But EARRING might belong to another category...

4. Let me think about OUROBOROS and HISTAMINE:
   - Both have unusual letter patterns
   - OUROBOROS - a circular snake symbol
   - HISTAMINE - a chemical
   - MYSTERY - a genre/unknown thing

5. Wait - could there be a pattern with words that contain other hidden words?
   - EARRING = EAR + RING
   - HERRING = HER + RING (though it's actually a fish)
   - HISTAMINE = HIST + AMINE or HIS + TAMINE?
   - OUROBOROS = ?

6. Let me think about "O" patterns or circular things:
   - OUROBOROS is circular
   - NECKLACE is circular
   - EARRING is circular
   - But HERRING isn't...

7. Actually, thinking about clothing/accessories worn at a specific type of event or by a specific person:
   - MESH SHIRT, PLEATHER VEST - these seem like stereotypical items
   - Maybe gay bar/pride attire? Or 80s fashion?

8. Let me reconsider - things that could follow or precede a common word:
   - RED HERRING (misleading clue)
   - MYSTERY could relate to this...

MYSTERY, HERRING, OUROBOROS, HISTAMINE

These must form the last category. Let me figure out what connects them:

1. MYSTERY - unknown, genre, puzzle
2. HERRING - a type of fish (also RED HERRING is a misleading clue)
3. OUROBOROS - a snake eating its own tail, symbol of infinity/cycles
4. HISTAMINE - a chemical compound involved in immune responses

What could connect these four?

Let me think about hidden patterns:
- Do they all contain a hidden word?
- HERRING contains "RING"
- HISTAMINE contains... "HIS" or "HIST" or "AMINE"
- OUROBOROS contains... "ORO" (gold in Spanish)?
- MYSTERY contains... "MY" or "STER"

Wait - could they all contain something that sounds like or spells a word?

- HER-RING (HERRING)
- HIST-AMINE (HISTAMINE) - HIST sounds like "HISSED"?
- MY-STERY (MYSTERY)
- OURO-BOROS

Hmm, let me think differently. Could they all contain a possessive pronoun?
- HER-ring (HER)
- HIS-tamine (HIS)
- MY-stery (MY)
- OURO-boros... OUR?? Yes! OUR-oboros!

That's it! They all contain possessive pronouns:
- MY in MYSTERY
- HER in HERRING
- HIS in HISTAMINE
- OUR in OUROBOROS
