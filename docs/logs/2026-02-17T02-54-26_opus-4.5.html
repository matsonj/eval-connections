First, let me list them out: STOVETOP, WING, KIND, MICROWAVE, TENDER, FIN, TRIFLE, ARM, FRITTER, POPPER, FIDDLE, SWEET, WARM, THROW, FLIPPER, KETTLE

Let me think about possible categories:

1. Things that can follow "CORN":
- POPPER (corn popper)
- FRITTER (corn fritter)
- Let me think of more... not sure about others

2. Body parts / Appendages:
- WING
- FIN
- ARM
- FLIPPER
These could all be appendages or limbs!

3. Ways to cook / Cooking methods:
- STOVETOP
- MICROWAVE
- Let me think... 

4. "___ POTATO" or "POTATO ___":
- SWEET (sweet potato)
- WARM (?) 
- No, that doesn't work

5. Things that go with "CHIP":
- MICROWAVE (microwave chip?)
- Let me think differently

6. "JALAPENO ___":
- POPPER (jalapeno popper)

7. Words that can follow "CORN":
- POPPER (corn popper)
- FRITTER (corn fritter - though usually "corn fritters")
- Actually...

8. Things that can precede or follow certain words:
- KETTLE - kettle corn, kettlebell
- POPPER - party popper, corn popper

9. Words meaning "to waste time" or "to play around":
- FIDDLE (fiddle around)
- TRIFLE (trifle with)
- Let me think of more...

10. "Legal ___" or "___ LEGAL":
- TENDER (legal tender)

11. CORN types or corn-related:
- KETTLE (kettle corn)
- POPPER (corn popper)
- Wait, what about SWEET (sweet corn)?
- And... hmm

12. Types of popcorn:
- KETTLE (kettle corn)
- MICROWAVE (microwave popcorn)
- STOVETOP (stovetop popcorn)
- Hmm, need a fourth...

Wait! Let me reconsider popcorn types:
- KETTLE (kettle corn)
- MICROWAVE (microwave popcorn)
- STOVETOP (stovetop popcorn)
- What else? AIR-POPPED... but that's not here

13. "___ CORN":
- KETTLE (kettle corn)
- SWEET (sweet corn)
- POPPER? No, that's "corn popper"
- CANDY? Not here

14. Body appendages used for movement:
- WING (birds fly)
- FIN (fish swim)
- ARM (humans)
- FLIPPER (dolphins/seals)
These are all appendages/limbs! This seems very strong.

15. Words that can mean "to handle carelessly" or "waste":
- FRITTER (fritter away)
- FIDDLE (fiddle with)
- TRIFLE (trifle with)
- THROW (throw away)
These could all mean to waste or spend carelessly!

Actually, let me check:
- FRITTER away (to waste)
- FIDDLE around/with (to waste time)
- TRIFLE with (to treat without seriousness)
- THROW away (to waste)

Hmm, these are all verbs meaning to waste or treat carelessly!

Let me reconsider the appendages:
- WING
- FIN  
- ARM
- FLIPPER

These are all body parts used for movement in different animals. This seems like a very solid category.

I'm most confident in the appendages category (WING, FIN, ARM, FLIPPER) as these are all clearly limbs/appendages.

Let me also consider:
- TENDER, KIND, WARM, SWEET - could these be related? They could all describe personality traits or feelings?

Actually:
- KIND (kind-hearted, a kind person)
- TENDER (tender-hearted)
- WARM (warm-hearted, warm person)
- SWEET (sweet person)

These could all be adjectives describing a person's gentle/caring nature!

I'm going to go with the appendages first as it seems most concrete: WING, FIN, ARM, FLIPPER</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
WING, FIN, ARM, FLIPPER

Now let me work with the remaining 12 words:

STOVETOP, KIND, MICROWAVE, TENDER, TRIFLE, FRITTER, POPPER, FIDDLE, SWEET, WARM, THROW, KETTLE

Let me reconsider my earlier theories:

1. Words meaning to waste or treat carelessly (verbs):
- FRITTER (fritter away - to waste)
- FIDDLE (fiddle around - to waste time)
- TRIFLE (trifle with - to treat without seriousness)
- THROW (throw away - to waste)

Wait, but these need to work as verbs meaning to waste. Let me verify:
- FRITTER away money/time ✓
- FIDDLE around ✓ (waste time)
- TRIFLE with ✓ (treat carelessly)
- THROW away ✓ (waste)

Hmm, but FIDDLE doesn't quite fit the "waste" meaning as cleanly...

2. Gentle/caring personality adjectives:
- KIND
- TENDER
- WARM
- SWEET

These all describe a caring, gentle person or disposition. This seems strong!

3. Popcorn-related:
- STOVETOP (stovetop popcorn)
- MICROWAVE (microwave popcorn)
- KETTLE (kettle corn)
- POPPER (corn popper? or popcorn popper?)

Actually, let me think about what these could precede or follow:
- KETTLE corn
- MICROWAVE popcorn
- STOVETOP popcorn
- And POPPER... 

4. "JALAPENO ___":
- POPPER (jalapeno popper)

5. Could these go with "CORN"?
- KETTLE corn ✓
- SWEET corn ✓
- Wait, what else?

6. Types of corn:
- KETTLE (kettle corn)
- SWEET (sweet corn)
- Hmm...

Let me focus on the personality adjectives: KIND, TENDER, WARM, SWEET
These all describe someone who is caring/gentle. This seems like a solid category.

Alternatively, these could all precede something:
- KIND of
- TENDER loving care
- WARM regards
- SWEET dreams

Or they could all follow something... like "CHICKEN ___":
- CHICKEN TENDER ✓
- CHICKEN WING (already used)
- Not really working

Wait! What about "___ HEARTED":
- KIND-hearted ✓
- TENDER-hearted ✓
- WARM-hearted ✓
- SWEET... hmm, not really "sweet-hearted"

Let me think of another connection. What about words that can come before a specific word?

"___ POTATO":
- SWEET potato ✓
- Hmm, not the others

Let me go back to the "waste time/treat carelessly" verbs:
- FRITTER (fritter away)
- FIDDLE (fiddle with/around)
- TRIFLE (trifle with)
- What's the fourth? THROW doesn't fit as well...

Actually, maybe it's "AWAY" that follows:
- FRITTER away ✓
- THROW away ✓
- FIDDLE away? (not common)
- TRIFLE away? (not common)

Let me think about KIND, TENDER, WARM, SWEET again. I'm fairly confident these are all adjectives describing a gentle, caring disposition.

I'll go with KIND, TENDER, WARM, SWEET.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Two down, two to go. Let me look at the remaining 8 words:

STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, TRIFLE, FRITTER, POPPER, FIDDLE, THROW, KETTLE

Let me think about possible categories:

1. Popcorn-related words (ways to make/types of popcorn):
- STOVETOP (stovetop popcorn)
- MICROWAVE (microwave popcorn)
- KETTLE (kettle corn)
- POPPER (popcorn popper)

This seems like a strong category! All four relate to popcorn preparation or types.

2. Words meaning to waste or spend carelessly:
- FRITTER (fritter away)
- TRIFLE (trifle with)
- FIDDLE (fiddle around/away)
- THROW (throw away)

Hmm, but these don't all mean exactly "to waste." Let me reconsider.

Actually, let me think about what could connect FRITTER, TRIFLE, FIDDLE, THROW...

Could they all precede or follow a common word?
- FRITTER away ✓
- THROW away ✓
- FIDDLE away? (less common but possible)
- TRIFLE away? (not really)

What about "___ with":
- FIDDLE with ✓
- TRIFLE with ✓
- THROW with? (not really)
- FRITTER with? (not really)

What if they're all things you can do that mean to waste time or not take seriously?
- FIDDLE (fiddle around)
- TRIFLE (trifle with something)
- FRITTER (fritter away time)
- Hmm, THROW doesn't fit well here

Let me reconsider the popcorn category - it seems very strong:
- STOVETOP popcorn
- MICROWAVE popcorn
- KETTLE corn
- POPPER (popcorn popper or air popper)

Yes, I'm confident in this. All four words relate to popcorn making methods or equipment.

I'll guess the popcorn category: STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, KETTLE, POPPER</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

TRIFLE, FRITTER, FIDDLE, THROW

These must form the last category. Let me think about what connects them:

1. Words meaning to waste or spend carelessly:
- FRITTER (fritter away - to waste money/time)
- TRIFLE (trifle with - to treat without seriousness)
- FIDDLE (fiddle around - to waste time)
- THROW (throw away - to waste/discard)

2. Could they all follow or precede a common word?
- "_____ AWAY": FRITTER away, THROW away, FIDDLE away(?), TRIFLE away(?)

3. Could they all be things you can do idly or carelessly?

4. Wait - could these all be desserts or food items that also work as verbs?
- TRIFLE (a dessert)
- FRITTER (a fried food)
- FIDDLE (not a food)
- THROW (not a food)

Hmm, that doesn't work.

5. Could they go with a specific word?
- FIDDLE with
- TRIFLE with
- Hmm...

Actually, since these are the last four words, they must be the final category. The connection might be verbs meaning to waste time or treat something carelessly/not seriously:

- FRITTER away (waste)
- TRIFLE with (treat carelessly)
- FIDDLE with/around (mess around, waste time)
- THROW away (waste, discard)

Or perhaps they can all precede "AWAY" to mean waste:
- FRITTER away ✓
- THROW away ✓
- FIDDLE away (less common but valid)
- TRIFLE away (rare but possible)

These are the last four, so I'll guess them!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me consider different possible groupings:

1. **Bedding items**: SHAM, BLANKET, SHEET - these are all things you find on a bed. I need a fourth... THROW could be a "throw blanket" or "throw pillow"! So: SHAM, BLANKET, SHEET, THROW

2. **Card game actions**: DRAW, PASS, DISCARD, PLAY - these are all things you do in card games. This seems strong!

3. **Government departments/Cabinet positions**: STATE (Department of State), JUSTICE (Department of Justice), ENERGY (Department of Energy), LABOR (Department of Labor) - these are all U.S. Cabinet departments!

4. **Words that go with "promise" or keeping commitments**: FULFILL, UPHOLD, KEEP, HONOR - these all relate to keeping a promise or commitment. You can FULFILL a promise, UPHOLD a promise, KEEP a promise, HONOR a promise.

Let me verify each category:
- Bedding: SHAM (pillow sham), BLANKET, SHEET, THROW (throw blanket) ✓
- Card games: DRAW, PASS, DISCARD, PLAY ✓
- Cabinet departments: STATE, JUSTICE, ENERGY, LABOR ✓
- Promise-related verbs: FULFILL, UPHOLD, KEEP, HONOR ✓

All 16 words seem to fit perfectly into these 4 categories! Let me start with what I think is the most confident guess.

The Cabinet departments seem very specific and clear: STATE, JUSTICE, ENERGY, LABOR - all are U.S. Cabinet departments (Secretary of State, Attorney General heads Justice, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Labor).

Actually, let me reconsider - the promise/commitment verbs also seem very strong: FULFILL, UPHOLD, KEEP, HONOR a promise/oath/commitment.

I'll go with the Cabinet departments first as it's a very specific, factual category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

2. **Card game actions**: DRAW, PASS, DISCARD, PLAY - all actions in card games

3. **Promise-related verbs**: FULFILL, UPHOLD, KEEP, HONOR - all verbs meaning to maintain/keep a promise or commitment

Let me verify these still work:

- Promise verbs: FULFILL, UPHOLD, KEEP, HONOR ✓

That's exactly 12 words in 3 categories of 4 each. Perfect!

First, let me identify what each word might relate to:

1. FUJIFILM - Camera/film company
2. RUSHMORE - Mount Rushmore (famous monument)
3. KISSCAM - Stadium feature (camera that shows couples)
4. OLYMPUS - Camera company, also a mountain in Greece
5. VENETIAN - Related to Venice, also a type of blinds, also a casino in Las Vegas
6. SCOREBOARD - Stadium feature
7. HASSELBLAD - Camera company
8. SKYBOX - Stadium feature (luxury seating)
9. CREAMSICLE - Ice cream treat (orange and vanilla)
10. JUMBOTRON - Stadium feature (large screen)
11. PARMESAN - Type of cheese, from Parma, Italy
12. BOLOGNESE - Sauce/dish from Bologna, Italy
13. JOURNEYMAN - A skilled worker, also a band
14. ASTROTURF - Artificial grass, stadium feature
15. POLAROID - Camera company
16. NEAPOLITAN - From Naples, Italy; also ice cream flavor

Potential categories I see:

**Camera/Film companies**: FUJIFILM, OLYMPUS, HASSELBLAD, POLAROID
- These are all camera manufacturers

**Stadium features**: KISSCAM, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX, JUMBOTRON, ASTROTURF
- Wait, that's 5 words. Let me reconsider...

**Italian cities (things named after Italian cities)**: 
- VENETIAN (Venice)
- PARMESAN (Parma)
- BOLOGNESE (Bologna)
- NEAPOLITAN (Naples)
- This seems like a strong category!

**Things with "Mount" or mountains**: RUSHMORE (Mount Rushmore), OLYMPUS (Mount Olympus)... need more

Let me reconsider. The camera companies seem solid: FUJIFILM, OLYMPUS, HASSELBLAD, POLAROID

But wait - could there be a "MOUNT ___" category?
- Mount RUSHMORE
- Mount OLYMPUS
- Mount FUJI (FUJIFILM?)
- Hmm, that doesn't quite work

Actually, looking at this differently - could some of these be related to bands?
- JOURNEY (JOURNEYMAN has JOURNEY in it)
- Could ASTROTURF relate to something?

Let me focus on the strongest category I see: Italian city-derived words
VENETIAN, PARMESAN, BOLOGNESE, NEAPOLITAN - all derived from Italian cities

This seems like the most solid guess to start with.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

FUJIFILM, RUSHMORE, KISSCAM, OLYMPUS, SCOREBOARD, HASSELBLAD, SKYBOX, CREAMSICLE, JUMBOTRON, JOURNEYMAN, ASTROTURF, POLAROID

Let me reconsider my categories:

**Camera/Film companies**: FUJIFILM, OLYMPUS, HASSELBLAD, POLAROID
- These are all camera/photography equipment manufacturers
- This still seems very strong

**Stadium features**: KISSCAM, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX, JUMBOTRON, ASTROTURF
- That's 5 words, so one must belong to another category

Let me think about what else these could connect to:

**Words that can follow "MOUNT"**:
- Mount RUSHMORE
- Mount OLYMPUS
- Hmm, need 2 more...

**Rock bands**: 
- JOURNEY (from JOURNEYMAN)
- Could others hide band names?

Wait, let me think about compound words or hidden words:
- KISSCAM - KISS (the band!)
- JOURNEYMAN - JOURNEY (the band!)
- ASTROTURF - could this relate to something?
- SCOREBOARD - SCORE?

Let me think about bands:
- KISS
- JOURNEY
- What about CREAM (CREAMSICLE)?
- RUSH (RUSHMORE)?

So: KISSCAM (KISS), JOURNEYMAN (JOURNEY), CREAMSICLE (CREAM), RUSHMORE (RUSH)
These are all rock bands! KISS, JOURNEY, CREAM, RUSH

This seems like a very clever category - words that contain rock band names at the beginning!

Let me go with the camera companies first since that's more straightforward:
FUJIFILM, OLYMPUS, HASSELBLAD, POLAROID</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

**Stadium features**: KISSCAM, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX, JUMBOTRON, ASTROTURF
- That's still 5 words, so one must belong elsewhere

**Rock bands hidden in words**:
- RUSHMORE - RUSH (the band)
- KISSCAM - KISS (the band)
- CREAMSICLE - CREAM (the band)
- JOURNEYMAN - JOURNEY (the band)

This seems like a very strong category! All four words start with the name of a classic rock band:

First, let me list them out: COMPLETE, OVER, HARD TACO, BELT, SLUG, M&amp;M, THROUGH, GULP, LAP, BULL, DONE, UNDER, SNAIL, EGG, WATCH, SHOT

Looking for patterns:

1. Words that can follow "OVER": DONE (overdone), SHOT (overshot), LAP (overlap), WATCH (overwatch)... hmm

2. Words that can precede or follow another word:
- BELT, SLUG, GULP, SHOT - these could all be ways to drink quickly (belt down, slug, gulp, shot)
- Actually, BELT, SLUG, GULP, SHOT could all mean "a drink" or "to drink quickly"

3. SNAIL, BULL, EGG - things that can precede SHELL? Snail shell, bull... no. 

4. M&amp;M, HARD TACO - these seem like specific food items or brands

5. OVER, UNDER, THROUGH - prepositions or positions
- Could be parts of compound words

6. COMPLETE, DONE, OVER, THROUGH - words meaning "finished"
- "I'm done" = "I'm finished"
- "It's over" = "It's finished"
- "I'm through" = "I'm finished"
- "Complete" = finished
These four all can mean "finished" or indicate completion!

7. Let me reconsider BELT, SLUG, GULP, SHOT as drinking terms:
- "Take a shot" = drink
- "Belt one back" = drink
- "Slug of whiskey" = a drink
- "Gulp it down" = drink quickly
This seems strong!

8. SNAIL, BULL, EGG, LAP - things related to races?
- Snail's pace
- Bull run?
- Egg and spoon race?
- Lap (of a race)

9. M&amp;M, HARD TACO - Taco Bell menu items?
- Actually, HARD TACO is a Taco Bell item
- What about M&amp;M? 

10. ___ SHELL: EGG shell, SNAIL shell, HARD TACO shell... 
- EGG SHELL
- SNAIL SHELL
- TACO SHELL (HARD TACO could relate)
- What else? SHELL could work with...

11. Wait - things that have shells: EGG, SNAIL, HARD TACO (taco shell), and... M&amp;M has a candy shell!
- "Melts in your mouth, not in your hand" - M&amp;M has a shell
- EGG - egg shell
- SNAIL - snail shell
- HARD TACO - taco shell

Actually, let me reconsider the "finished" category: COMPLETE, DONE, OVER, THROUGH
These all can mean "finished" in conversation:
- "I'm done"
- "It's over"
- "I'm through"
- "It's complete"

I think this is a strong category. Let me go with this first.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me reconsider my earlier theories:

1. Drinking terms: BELT, SLUG, GULP, SHOT
- "Take a shot" = drink
- "Belt one back" = drink quickly
- "Slug of whiskey" = a drink
- "Gulp it down" = drink
This still seems very strong!

2. Things with shells: EGG, SNAIL, HARD TACO, M&amp;M
- EGG shell
- SNAIL shell
- TACO shell (hard taco)
- M&amp;M has a candy shell
This also seems strong!

3. What about: BULL, LAP, WATCH, UNDER?
- Could these go with a common word?
- BULL___ : bulldog, bullpen, bullring
- LAP___ : laptop, lapdog
- WATCH___ : watchdog
- UNDER___ : underdog
- DOG! BULLDOG, LAPDOG, WATCHDOG, UNDERDOG!

4. That would leave: HARD TACO, BELT, SLUG, M&amp;M, GULP, SNAIL, EGG, SHOT
- If BELT, SLUG, GULP, SHOT are drinking terms...
- That leaves HARD TACO, M&amp;M, SNAIL, EGG as the shell category

Let me verify the ___DOG category:
- BULLDOG ✓
- LAPDOG ✓
- WATCHDOG ✓
- UNDERDOG ✓

This is very strong! I'll go with the drinking terms since I'm most confident in that.

Actually, let me go with the ___DOG category since it's a clean word association:

- "Belt one back" = drink quickly
- "Slug of whiskey" = a portion of drink

First, let me list them out:
BUNDLE, KERNEL, PALEONTOLOGIST, LAVENDER, MINT, MOSQUITO, GRIMACE, PEARL, AMBER, FORTUNE, EGGPLANT, AMETHYST, DINOSAUR, TIDBIT, PILE, NUGGET

Let me look for potential categories:

1. Purple/violet shades: LAVENDER, EGGPLANT, AMETHYST - these are all shades of purple. I need a 4th... GRIMACE (the McDonald's character is purple)! That could work.

2. Things that can come before "cookie": FORTUNE (fortune cookie), MINT (could be a stretch)... not quite.

3. Small amounts/pieces of information: KERNEL, TIDBIT, NUGGET - these all mean small pieces (kernel of truth, tidbit of information, nugget of wisdom). Need a 4th... could PEARL work (pearl of wisdom)?

4. Things preserved in amber: MOSQUITO, DINOSAUR (DNA)... this connects to PALEONTOLOGIST who studies fossils, and AMBER itself. Wait, that's only 3 plus amber.

5. McDonald's characters: GRIMACE (purple guy), HAMBURGLAR... hmm, not seeing others here.

6. Shades of purple: LAVENDER, EGGPLANT, AMETHYST, GRIMACE (purple McDonald's character)

7. Words that can follow a common word:
- BUNDLE, PILE - these are amounts/quantities
- FORTUNE, MINT - could relate to money (worth a fortune, worth a mint)

8. Things in Jurassic Park: AMBER (with mosquito inside), MOSQUITO, DINOSAUR, PALEONTOLOGIST - these all relate to Jurassic Park!

Let me reconsider:
- Jurassic Park connection: AMBER, MOSQUITO, DINOSAUR, PALEONTOLOGIST - In Jurassic Park, a PALEONTOLOGIST discovers that DINOSAUR DNA was extracted from a MOSQUITO preserved in AMBER. This is a strong thematic connection!

- Purple things: LAVENDER, EGGPLANT, AMETHYST, GRIMACE - all purple colored

- Small bits of wisdom/knowledge: KERNEL (of truth), NUGGET (of wisdom), TIDBIT (of information), PEARL (of wisdom)

- That would leave: BUNDLE, MINT, FORTUNE, PILE
  - These could all relate to money: a BUNDLE of cash, MINT condition/worth a mint, FORTUNE, PILE of money
  - Or they could all precede something...

Let me verify my strongest group - the purple things:
- LAVENDER - purple flower/color
- EGGPLANT - purple vegetable/emoji
- AMETHYST - purple gemstone
- GRIMACE - purple McDonald's character

This seems like a solid category. Let me start with this one.

Actually, let me reconsider the Jurassic Park group as it's very specific:
AMBER, MOSQUITO, DINOSAUR, PALEONTOLOGIST - these all directly relate to the plot of Jurassic Park

I think the purple/shades group is cleaner. Let me go with that first.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now let me work with the remaining 12 words:

BUNDLE, KERNEL, PALEONTOLOGIST, MINT, MOSQUITO, PEARL, AMBER, FORTUNE, DINOSAUR, TIDBIT, PILE, NUGGET

Let me reconsider my earlier hypotheses:

1. Jurassic Park connection: AMBER, MOSQUITO, DINOSAUR, PALEONTOLOGIST
   - In Jurassic Park, dinosaur DNA was extracted from mosquitoes preserved in amber, and paleontologists are central characters
   - This is a very strong thematic connection

2. Small bits of wisdom/information: KERNEL (of truth), NUGGET (of wisdom/information), TIDBIT (of information), PEARL (of wisdom)
   - These all can precede "of wisdom" or similar phrases meaning small valuable pieces of knowledge

3. Money-related terms: BUNDLE, MINT, FORTUNE, PILE
   - A BUNDLE of money
   - Worth a MINT / MINT condition
   - A FORTUNE
   - A PILE of money
   - These could all describe large amounts of money or value

Let me verify group 2 more carefully:
- KERNEL of truth ✓
- NUGGET of wisdom ✓
- TIDBIT of information ✓
- PEARL of wisdom ✓

This seems very solid - they all mean "small piece of valuable information/truth"

Let me verify group 3:
- BUNDLE (of cash) ✓
- MINT (worth a mint, in mint condition) ✓
- FORTUNE (worth a fortune) ✓
- PILE (pile of money) ✓

Both groups seem strong. Let me go with the Jurassic Park group since it's very specific and I'm confident about it.

My earlier hypotheses:

1. Small bits of wisdom/information: KERNEL (of truth), NUGGET (of wisdom/information), TIDBIT (of information), PEARL (of wisdom)
   - These all can describe small valuable pieces of knowledge/truth

2. Money-related terms: BUNDLE, MINT, FORTUNE, PILE
   - A BUNDLE of money
   - Worth a MINT
   - A FORTUNE

These two groups would perfectly split the remaining 8 words into two groups of 4. Let me verify:

Group 1 - "___ of wisdom/truth/information":
- KERNEL of truth ✓
- NUGGET of wisdom ✓
- TIDBIT of information ✓
- PEARL of wisdom ✓

Group 2 - Large amounts of money / "worth a ___":
- BUNDLE (of cash) ✓
- MINT (worth a mint) ✓
- FORTUNE (worth a fortune) ✓
- PILE (pile of money) ✓

Both groups seem very solid. I'll go with the "small bits of wisdom" group first since phrases like "pearl of wisdom," "kernel of truth," "nugget of information," and "tidbit" are very common expressions.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me list all the words: WOOD, SCROOGE, WOODEN, FOGHORN, AWKWARD, WOODY, WOODSTOCK, COULD, STIFF, THEREFORE, CLASSICS, CREATE, WOODCHUCK, STILTED, CHUCK, GUTHRIE

Let me look for patterns:

1. Words containing "WOOD": WOOD, WOODEN, WOODY, WOODSTOCK, WOODCHUCK - that's 5 words, so this can't be the category as-is.

2. Famous characters named after these words:
- SCROOGE (Ebenezer Scrooge, or Scrooge McDuck)
- FOGHORN (Foghorn Leghorn - cartoon rooster)
- WOODY (Woody Woodpecker, or Toy Story's Woody)
- WOODSTOCK (Snoopy's bird friend from Peanuts)
- WOODCHUCK (not a famous character I can think of)

3. Wait, let me think about Peanuts characters:
- WOODSTOCK is Snoopy's bird friend
- CHUCK is what Peppermint Patty calls Charlie Brown
- Could there be more?

4. "______ Allen" - directors/celebrities:
- WOODY Allen (director)
- Could others fit?

5. Synonyms for stiff/uncomfortable acting:
- WOODEN, AWKWARD, STIFF, STILTED - these all describe bad or uncomfortable acting/delivery!

6. Words that can follow "WOULD":
- COULD sounds like "WOULD" related... no wait

7. Let me think about ___ Allen or first names:
- WOODY Allen
- GUTHRIE could be Woody Guthrie or Arlo Guthrie

8. Famous "Woodys":
- WOODY Allen
- WOODY Guthrie
- WOODY Harrelson
- WOODY (from Toy Story)

Wait! WOODY, GUTHRIE, WOODSTOCK - these could all relate to famous Woodys:
- Woody Guthrie (folk singer)
- Woody Allen
- Woody Harrelson

Actually, let me reconsider. What about words meaning "stiff/unnatural":
WOODEN, AWKWARD, STIFF, STILTED - these are all synonyms meaning unnatural or uncomfortable!

Let me also consider anagram or sound patterns:
- COULD sounds like "WOULD"
- WOOD, WOULD sound similar

Homophones or near-homophones:
- WOOD/WOULD
- CHUCK/... 

Let me think about "Famous ___" patterns:
- WOODY Guthrie, WOODY Allen, WOODY Harrelson
- Arlo GUTHRIE
- WOODSTOCK festival

I'm most confident about the synonyms for stiff/unnatural acting: WOODEN, AWKWARD, STIFF, STILTED. These all describe unnatural, forced, or uncomfortable behavior/performance.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now let me analyze the remaining words:

Remaining words: WOOD, SCROOGE, FOGHORN, WOODY, WOODSTOCK, COULD, THEREFORE, CLASSICS, CREATE, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK, GUTHRIE

Let me look for patterns again:

1. Famous "Woodys" - people whose first name is Woody:
- WOODY (itself)
- GUTHRIE (Woody Guthrie - folk singer)
- ALLEN would fit but it's not here
- HARRELSON would fit but it's not here

2. Peanuts characters:
- WOODSTOCK (Snoopy's bird friend)
- CHUCK (what Peppermint Patty calls Charlie Brown)
- Could SCROOGE fit? No, that's Dickens/Disney

3. Looney Tunes characters (first names):
- FOGHORN (Foghorn Leghorn)
- Could others be cartoon character first names?

4. Let me think about "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck":
- WOOD, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK, COULD/WOULD
- Wait, this is interesting! "How much WOOD WOULD a WOODCHUCK CHUCK if a WOODCHUCK COULD CHUCK WOOD"
- WOOD, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK, COULD - these are all words from that tongue twister!

5. Words that sound like they contain "WOULD":
- COULD (would/could rhyme)
- WOOD (sounds like would)

6. Let me verify the tongue twister theory:
"How much WOOD WOULD a WOODCHUCK CHUCK if a WOODCHUCK COULD CHUCK WOOD"
- WOOD ✓
- WOODCHUCK ✓
- CHUCK ✓
- COULD ✓

This seems like a very strong connection! All four words appear in the famous tongue twister.

Other potential categories I see:
- CLASSICS, CREATE, THEREFORE... these might have Latin roots or be related to education?
- SCROOGE, FOGHORN, WOODY, WOODSTOCK could be cartoon/character names

Remaining words: SCROOGE, FOGHORN, WOODY, WOODSTOCK, THEREFORE, CLASSICS, CREATE, GUTHRIE

Let me analyze these:

1. Famous "Woodys" - people whose first name is Woody:
- WOODY (but this is the name itself)
- GUTHRIE (Woody Guthrie - folk singer)
- WOODSTOCK? No, that's a place/festival/Peanuts bird
- Could there be others?

Wait, let me think about this differently. What if these are all last names of famous people named Woody?
- Woody GUTHRIE (folk singer)
- Woody ALLEN (director) - not here
- Woody HARRELSON (actor) - not here

Hmm, but WOODY itself is here. Let me think...

2. Cartoon characters (first names that go with last names):
- FOGHORN Leghorn (Looney Tunes rooster)
- SCROOGE McDuck (Disney)
- WOODY Woodpecker (cartoon)
- WOODSTOCK is Snoopy's bird...

Wait! What if these are all first names of cartoon characters with alliterative or repeated names?
- FOGHORN Leghorn
- SCROOGE McDuck (not alliterative though)
- WOODY Woodpecker
- Could WOODSTOCK fit? Woodstock is just Woodstock...

3. Let me think about ___ McDuck:
- SCROOGE McDuck
- Others?

4. Latin phrases or roots:
- THEREFORE could be related to "ergo"
- CREATE from "creare"
- CLASSICS...

5. Wait, what about "____ ergo ____" or Descartes quotes?
- "Cogito ergo sum" - I think therefore I am
- Could there be a pattern with Latin/philosophy?

6. Let me think about TBS or Turner networks:
- TBS shows lots of classics...
- Turner Classic Movies = TCM

7. What about radio/TV shows or hosts:
- Could these be NPR or radio related?

8. Arlo GUTHRIE is also famous - son of Woody Guthrie, sang at WOODSTOCK...
- Wait! WOODSTOCK festival performers?
- Arlo GUTHRIE performed at Woodstock
- Others?

9. Let me reconsider cartoon first names:
- FOGHORN (Foghorn Leghorn)
- SCROOGE (Scrooge McDuck)
- WOODY (Woody Woodpecker)
- What about WOODSTOCK? It's also a Peanuts character...

Actually, these could all be cartoon bird or animal characters:
- FOGHORN Leghorn (rooster)
- WOODSTOCK (bird from Peanuts)
- SCROOGE McDuck (duck)
- WOODY Woodpecker (woodpecker)

Yes! These are all cartoon birds!
- FOGHORN Leghorn - rooster/chicken
- WOODSTOCK - small yellow bird (Peanuts)
- SCROOGE McDuck - duck

Remaining words: THEREFORE, CLASSICS, CREATE, GUTHRIE

These must form the final category. Let me figure out what connects them:

- THEREFORE
- CLASSICS
- CREATE
- GUTHRIE

Hmm, what could connect these four?

1. Latin roots? 
- CREATE comes from Latin "creare"
- THEREFORE... 
- CLASSICS relates to classical studies

2. Could these all follow or precede a common word?
- ___ THEREFORE, ___ CLASSICS, ___ CREATE, ___ GUTHRIE
- THEREFORE ___, CLASSICS ___, CREATE ___, GUTHRIE ___

3. Wait, let me think about what sounds these start with:
- THEREFORE - "THERE"
- CLASSICS - "CLASS"
- CREATE - "CREE" or "CRE"
- GUTHRIE - "GUTH"

4. What if these can all follow a specific word?
- Turner CLASSICS (Turner Classic Movies - TCM)
- Could there be a pattern with Turner?

5. Arlo GUTHRIE... 
- Wait, Arlo! What about names that can be preceded by "ARLO"?
- Arlo GUTHRIE (folk singer)
- Arlo... THEREFORE? CREATE? CLASSICS?

6. What about theater/film:
- Theater could relate to all?

7. Let me think about hidden words or sounds:
- THEREFORE contains "ERE" and "FORE"
- Could these all contain a hidden word?

8. What if they can all be preceded by a number or something?
- "PRO" maybe? Pro-CREATE = procreate!
- THEREFORE... pro-THEREFORE? No.

9. What about "____ FOR ___" patterns?
- THERE-FOR-E has "FOR" in it
- Could others have "FOR"?

10. Wait! What about words that sound like they contain "FOUR"?
- THEREFORE = THERE + FOUR (sounds like "therefor")
- Hmm, not quite...

11. Let me think about this differently - hidden numbers?
- THEREFORE - contains "FORE" which sounds like "FOUR"
- CREATE - contains "ATE" which sounds like "EIGHT"
- CLASSICS - no obvious number
- GUTHRIE - contains "THREE" if you rearrange? No...

12. Actually, homophone numbers:
- thereFORE - FOUR
- creATE - EIGHT
- Could CLASSICS hide something? CLASS-ICS... SIX? No...
- GUTHRIE - contains THREE! GU-THREE

Wait! These might all contain homophones of numbers:
- THEREFORE - FOUR (fore)
- CREATE - EIGHT (ate)
- GUTHRIE - THREE (thrie sounds like three)
- CLASSICS - SIX? CLASS-IX? No... wait, CLASSI-CS... hmm

Let me reconsider. Actually:
- GUTHRIE sounds like it has "THREE" in it
- CREATE has "EIGHT" (ate)
- THEREFORE has "FOUR" (fore)
- CLASSICS... could have hidden number too

These must be the final four, so I'll guess them!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

SPREADSHEET, HONEYCOMB, FIX, ORGANISM, VINAIGRETTE, SOLAR PANEL, PHOTOSHOP, AIRBRUSH, TOUCH UP, CANDY CANE, TINSEL, STRING LIGHTS, PAIN, PAMPLEMOUSSE, ANGEL, CORNICHON

Let me look for potential categories:

1. Christmas tree decorations/ornaments:
- CANDY CANE (hung on tree)
- TINSEL (decorates tree)
- STRING LIGHTS (on tree)
- ANGEL (tree topper)
These all go on a Christmas tree!

2. Photo editing/retouching terms:
- PHOTOSHOP (edit photos)
- AIRBRUSH (technique to smooth photos)
- TOUCH UP (improve photos)
- FIX (repair/edit photos)
These could all be ways to edit/enhance photos.

3. French words (looking at PAIN, PAMPLEMOUSSE, CORNICHON):
- PAIN = bread in French
- PAMPLEMOUSSE = grapefruit in French
- CORNICHON = pickle/gherkin in French
- VINAIGRETTE = also French (salad dressing)
These are all French food words!

4. Things with cells/grid patterns:
- SPREADSHEET (has cells)
- HONEYCOMB (hexagonal cells)
- SOLAR PANEL (has cells)
- ORGANISM (made of cells)
These all contain or are made of "cells"!

Let me verify my groupings:
- Christmas tree: CANDY CANE, TINSEL, STRING LIGHTS, ANGEL ✓
- Photo editing: PHOTOSHOP, AIRBRUSH, TOUCH UP, FIX ✓
- French food words: PAIN, PAMPLEMOUSSE, CORNICHON, VINAIGRETTE ✓
- Things with cells: SPREADSHEET, HONEYCOMB, SOLAR PANEL, ORGANISM ✓

I'm most confident about the Christmas tree decorations as these are very clearly all things that go on a Christmas tree.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me list them out: MELT, FANTASY, VAPORIZE, BACKUP, FREEZE, HACK, HONEY, COVER, ALTERNATE, SOMEDAY, SHRINK, SUB, HERO, CONDENSE, COPPER, SUIT

Let me think about possible groupings:

1. **Phase changes / States of matter transitions**: MELT, VAPORIZE, FREEZE, CONDENSE - these are all phase transitions! Melt (solid to liquid), Vaporize (liquid to gas), Freeze (liquid to solid), Condense (gas to liquid). This seems like a strong category.

2. **Types of sandwiches**: HERO, SUB, MELT (like a tuna melt), CLUB? No CLUB... What about HONEY (honey baked ham?)... Actually HERO and SUB are both sandwich types. A MELT is also a sandwich type (like patty melt, tuna melt).

3. **Words that can follow "HONEY"**: HONEY + ? HONEYMOON, HONEYDEW, HONEYBEE...

4. **Substitute/replacement words**: BACKUP, ALTERNATE, SUB, COVER (as in "cover for someone") - these all mean substitute or stand-in!

5. **Terms of endearment**: HONEY, SUGAR? No SUGAR here...

6. **Cop/Police slang**: COPPER (old slang for cop), SUIT (slang for FBI/federal agent), HACK... 

7. **My Mariah Carey songs?**: FANTASY, SOMEDAY, HERO - these are all Mariah Carey songs! Let me think of a fourth... HONEY is also a Mariah Carey song! So FANTASY, SOMEDAY, HERO, HONEY could all be Mariah Carey songs.

8. **Computer terms**: HACK, BACKUP, FREEZE (computer freezing)...

Let me reconsider:

- Phase changes: MELT, VAPORIZE, FREEZE, CONDENSE - very strong
- Substitute words: BACKUP, ALTERNATE, SUB, COVER - very strong
- Mariah Carey songs: FANTASY, SOMEDAY, HERO, HONEY - this could be it!

The phase changes category seems very solid. Let me start with that one.

Actually, wait - if MELT is part of phase changes, it can't also be a sandwich. Let me verify the phase changes:
- MELT: solid → liquid ✓
- FREEZE: liquid → solid ✓
- VAPORIZE: liquid → gas ✓
- CONDENSE: gas → liquid ✓

This is a very clean category. I'll go with this first.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
MELT, VAPORIZE, FREEZE, CONDENSE

Now let me work with the remaining 12 words:

FANTASY, BACKUP, HACK, HONEY, COVER, ALTERNATE, SOMEDAY, SHRINK, SUB, HERO, COPPER, SUIT

Let me reconsider my earlier theories:

1. **Substitute/replacement words**: BACKUP, ALTERNATE, SUB, COVER - these all mean substitute or stand-in. BACKUP (backup plan/person), ALTERNATE (alternate choice), SUB (substitute), COVER (cover for someone). This seems very strong.

2. **Mariah Carey songs**: FANTASY, SOMEDAY, HERO, HONEY - these are all Mariah Carey #1 hits! 
   - "Fantasy" (1995)
   - "Someday" (1990)
   - "Hero" (1993)
   - "Honey" (1997)
   This is a strong category.

3. **Slang for types of people/professions**: 
   - COPPER (cop)
   - SUIT (business executive/FBI)
   - SHRINK (psychiatrist)
   - HACK (writer, taxi driver)
   This could be slang terms for professions!

4. **Words that can precede or follow something**: Not seeing a clear pattern yet.

Let me verify the "slang for professions" category:
- COPPER = police officer (old slang)
- SUIT = corporate executive or federal agent
- SHRINK = psychiatrist/psychologist
- HACK = writer (derogatory) or taxi driver

This seems like a solid category too!

So I have three strong candidates:
1. Substitute words: BACKUP, ALTERNATE, SUB, COVER
2. Mariah Carey songs: FANTASY, SOMEDAY, HERO, HONEY
3. Slang for professions: COPPER, SUIT, SHRINK, HACK

I'll go with the substitute/replacement words as it seems most straightforward and concrete.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me list them out:
PERCENTAGE, SHARE, INTELLIGENCE, POLE, COLUMN, POST, INTEREST, SECRETS, STAKE, MIND, INFORMATION, FOLLOW, OBSERVE, DIRT, REGARD, PILLAR

Let me think about potential categories:

1. **Structural supports/vertical things**: POLE, COLUMN, POST, PILLAR - these are all vertical structural elements or supports. This seems like a strong connection!

2. **Things related to "pay" or attention**: MIND, REGARD, OBSERVE, FOLLOW - these could all follow "pay" (pay mind, pay regard) or relate to paying attention. Actually, "pay attention" words: MIND (pay no mind), REGARD (pay no regard), OBSERVE could work differently...

3. **Business/ownership terms**: SHARE, STAKE, INTEREST, PERCENTAGE - these all relate to ownership or portions of something (like in a company). This also seems strong!

4. **Gossip/information types**: DIRT, SECRETS, INTELLIGENCE, INFORMATION - these could all be types of information or gossip you might gather. "Dirt" as in gossip, "intelligence" as in spy information...

5. **Words that can follow "TRADE"**: SECRETS (trade secrets), POST (trading post?)... not quite.

6. **Words that can precede "AGENCY"**: INTELLIGENCE (intelligence agency)...

Let me reconsider:
- SHARE, STAKE, INTEREST, PERCENTAGE - all can mean a portion/ownership in something
- POLE, COLUMN, POST, PILLAR - all vertical supports
- DIRT, SECRETS, INTELLIGENCE, INFORMATION - types of info/gossip
- MIND, FOLLOW, OBSERVE, REGARD - verbs related to attention?

Wait, let me think about "_____ COLUMN":
- COLUMN could be part of "gossip column"

What about words that can follow a common word?
- POLE: tent pole, fishing pole, North Pole
- POST: fence post, goal post, blog post

Let me think about "VICTORIA'S SECRET" - SECRETS
"INSIDE INFORMATION" - INFORMATION

Actually, looking at MIND, FOLLOW, OBSERVE, REGARD - these could all work with "never" or relate to ignoring/paying attention to something.

Let me start with what seems most certain: the vertical support structures.

POLE, COLUMN, POST, PILLAR - all are vertical structural supports or pillars. This seems like the strongest category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

PERCENTAGE, SHARE, INTELLIGENCE, INTEREST, SECRETS, STAKE, MIND, INFORMATION, FOLLOW, OBSERVE, DIRT, REGARD

Let me reconsider my earlier categories:

1. **Business/ownership terms**: SHARE, STAKE, INTEREST, PERCENTAGE - these all relate to ownership or portions of something (like in a company). A "stake" in a company, "interest" in a business, "share" of stock, "percentage" of ownership. This still seems very strong!

2. **Types of information/gossip**: DIRT, SECRETS, INTELLIGENCE, INFORMATION - these could all be types of information. "Dirt" as in gossip, "intelligence" as in spy/gathered information, "secrets" and "information" are straightforward.

3. **Attention-related verbs**: MIND, FOLLOW, OBSERVE, REGARD - these could relate to paying attention or heeding something. "Mind your manners," "follow the rules," "observe the law," "regard with attention."

Wait, let me think about this differently. What if some of these words can follow or precede a common word?

"Never ___": Never mind, never follow?

"Pay ___": Pay attention... pay mind? Pay regard?

"Inside ___": Inside information, inside secrets?

Let me think about "_____ AGENCY": Intelligence agency...

What about words that go with "TRADE"?
- TRADE SECRETS - yes!
- TRADE INFORMATION?

Hmm, let me think about Victoria's Secret brand... not quite.

Let me reconsider: SHARE, STAKE, INTEREST, PERCENTAGE all definitely relate to ownership portions. This is my strongest remaining guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

INTELLIGENCE, SECRETS, MIND, INFORMATION, FOLLOW, OBSERVE, DIRT, REGARD

Let me think about the two remaining categories:

1. **Types of information/gossip**: DIRT, SECRETS, INTELLIGENCE, INFORMATION - these could all be types of information or things you gather. "Dirt" as in gossip/compromising info, "intelligence" as in gathered spy info, "secrets" and "information" are clear.

2. **Attention/heed-related words**: MIND, FOLLOW, OBSERVE, REGARD - these could all relate to paying attention to or heeding something. 
   - "Mind the gap" / "Mind your manners"
   - "Follow the rules" / "Follow instructions"
   - "Observe the law" / "Observe regulations"
   - "Regard" as in "have regard for"

Actually, let me think about what these might have in common more specifically:

Could they all follow "PAY"?
- Pay mind? (not common)
- Pay regard? (pay no regard)
- Pay attention... but attention isn't here

Could they all follow "NEVER"?
- Never mind - YES!
- Never follow? - not really a phrase

Could they all precede or follow another word?
- MIND, FOLLOW, OBSERVE, REGARD... 

What if they can all precede "THE LAW" or similar?
- Observe the law - YES
- Follow the law - YES
- Mind the law? - not common
- Regard the law? - not common

Wait, what about words meaning "to heed" or "comply with"?
- Mind (as in "mind the rules")
- Follow (as in "follow directions")
- Observe (as in "observe the rules")
- Regard (as in "have regard for")

- FOLLOW - as in "follow the rules"
- OBSERVE - as in "observe the law"
- REGARD - as in "have regard for" or "regard the rules"

These all can mean to heed, pay attention to, or comply with something. They could all be synonyms for "heed" or "pay attention to."

Alternatively, they could all follow a common word or precede a common word. Let me think...

Could they all follow "WITH"?
- With regard - YES (with regard to)
- With mind? - not really
- With interest? - but interest is gone

Could they all precede "FOR"?
- Regard for - YES
- Mind for? - not common
- Observe for? - not really
- Follow for? - not really

I think the connection is that they all mean "to heed" or "to pay attention to/comply with" - like observing rules, following instructions, minding warnings, regarding advice.

This has to be correct since these are the only 4 remaining words!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Available words: REMOTE, TOKEN, HYBRID, COMPOUND, DEED, CROSS, LODGE, BIRTH, WEDGE, STICK, PLANT, BLEND, CRUISE, HOTEL, HOUSE, QUALITY

Let me think about possible groupings:

1. Words that can follow "CONTROL":
- REMOTE control
- BIRTH control
- CRUISE control
- QUALITY control
These all can precede "control"! That's a strong connection.

2. Types of accommodations/lodging:
- HOTEL
- LODGE
- HOUSE
- Could COMPOUND work? (like a residential compound)

3. Words that can follow a common word:
- HOUSE: tree house, house plant...
- PLANT: house plant, power plant...

4. Words related to cars/driving:
- HYBRID (car type)
- STICK (shift)
- CRUISE (control)
- REMOTE (start)

5. Words that can precede "INTEREST":
- COMPOUND interest
- Let me think of others...

6. Words that can follow "GREEN":
- HOUSE (greenhouse)
- WEDGE (no)
- PLANT (no, but green plant is a thing)

7. Types of things in fitness/exercise:
- CROSS (crossfit, cross training)
- HYBRID
- COMPOUND (compound exercises)

8. Let me reconsider "___ control":
- REMOTE control
- BIRTH control
- CRUISE control
- QUALITY control
This seems very strong!

Wait, let me double-check:
- REMOTE control ✓
- BIRTH control ✓
- CRUISE control ✓
- QUALITY control ✓

This is a very strong pattern - all four words can precede "CONTROL" to make common phrases.

Let me also consider other patterns:
- TOKEN, DEED, PLANT could all be verbs
- WEDGE, STICK could be golf clubs
- HYBRID, CROSS, BLEND could relate to mixing

Actually, for golf:
- WEDGE (golf club)
- HYBRID (golf club)
- Could STICK work? Not really for golf...

Let me stick with my strongest guess: words that precede "CONTROL"
REMOTE, BIRTH, CRUISE, QUALITY</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: TOKEN, HYBRID, COMPOUND, DEED, CROSS, LODGE, WEDGE, STICK, PLANT, BLEND, HOTEL, HOUSE

Let me look for patterns:

1. Types of accommodations:
- LODGE
- HOTEL
- HOUSE
- Could work but need a 4th... COMPOUND? (residential compound)

2. Golf clubs:
- WEDGE (golf club)
- HYBRID (golf club)
- What else? Not STICK...

3. Words that can follow "MOTOR":
- LODGE (Motor Lodge)
- HOTEL (Motor Hotel = Motel origin)
- Hmm...

4. Words that can precede or follow another word:
- CROSS could go with many things
- COMPOUND could be compound interest, compound word

5. Verbs (actions):
- PLANT (to plant)
- LODGE (to lodge a complaint)
- STICK (to stick)
- WEDGE (to wedge)
- CROSS (to cross)
- DEED (not really a verb commonly)

6. Words that follow "SPLIT":
- Hmm, not obvious

7. Words related to mixing/combining:
- HYBRID
- BLEND
- CROSS
- COMPOUND
These all relate to combining or mixing things! Let me check:
- HYBRID: a mix of two things
- BLEND: mixing together
- CROSS: crossbreed, cross-pollinate
- COMPOUND: combining elements
This seems strong!

8. Another pattern - words that can follow "POWER":
- PLANT (power plant)
- HOUSE (powerhouse)
- Hmm...

Let me go with the "mixing/combining" category:
HYBRID, BLEND, CROSS, COMPOUND

Remaining words: TOKEN, DEED, LODGE, WEDGE, STICK, PLANT, HOTEL, HOUSE

Let me look for patterns among these 8 words:

1. Types of accommodations:
- LODGE
- HOTEL
- HOUSE
- Need a 4th... TOKEN? No. PLANT? No.

2. Words that can follow "MOTOR":
- LODGE (Motor Lodge)
- HOTEL (Motor Hotel - origin of "motel")

3. Words that can follow "TREE":
- HOUSE (treehouse)
- What else?

4. Verbs/Actions:
- LODGE (lodge a complaint)
- WEDGE (wedge something)
- STICK (stick something)
- PLANT (plant something)
These are all actions you can do! Let me verify:
- LODGE: to lodge a complaint, lodge an objection
- WEDGE: to wedge open a door
- STICK: to stick something somewhere
- PLANT: to plant seeds, plant evidence
These could all be verbs meaning to put/place something!

5. Words that can follow a common word:
- STEAK + HOUSE
- DOOR + WEDGE
- Hmm...

6. Words that can precede a common word:
- TOKEN + gesture?
- DEED + ?

7. Let me reconsider - things you can "drive":
- WEDGE (drive a wedge)
- Hmm...

8. Words following "DOOR":
- WEDGE (door wedge)
- Not really others...

Let me think about the verbs again - specifically verbs meaning to insert or place firmly:
- LODGE (lodge a bullet, something lodges somewhere)
- WEDGE (wedge in)
- STICK (stick in)
- PLANT (plant firmly)

These all can mean to place or fix something firmly in position!

This seems like a strong connection - let me go with it.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: TOKEN, DEED, HOTEL, HOUSE

These must form the final category. Let me figure out what connects them:

- TOKEN
- DEED
- HOTEL
- HOUSE

What could connect these four?

1. Monopoly game pieces/elements?
- HOTEL (you buy hotels in Monopoly)
- HOUSE (you buy houses in Monopoly)
- TOKEN (the game pieces are tokens)
- DEED (property deeds in Monopoly - the cards you get when you buy property!)

Yes! These are all things in the board game Monopoly!
- TOKEN: the playing pieces (car, thimble, dog, etc.)
- DEED: the property cards
- HOTEL: buildings you place on properties
- HOUSE: buildings you place on properties before hotels

This has to be the answer - all Monopoly-related terms!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me look for obvious connections:

1. Colors: BROWN, HAZEL, GREEN - these could be eye colors or just colors. Need a fourth... PEA could be "pea green"? CHEST could be "chestnut" which is a brown color?

2. Body parts: CHEST, HEAD - only two obvious ones

3. Quentin Tarantino movies: UNCHAINED (Django Unchained), DOGS (Reservoir Dogs), FICTION (Pulp Fiction)... need a fourth. Could BROWN be Jackie Brown? Yes! That's 4 Tarantino movies!

4. Positions/Titles: CHIEF, CHAIR, DIRECTOR, HEAD - these could all be leadership positions

5. Words that can follow "EXECUTIVE": CHIEF (executive chief?), DIRECTOR (executive director), CHAIR (executive chair)... 

6. Let me think about compound words or phrases:
- FIELD: field day, playing field, field goal
- LAWN: lawn mower, lawn chair
- GROUNDS: coffee grounds, grounds keeper
- CHEST: chest pain, treasure chest
- PEA: pea soup, pea coat

7. Types of coats: PEA (pea coat), could there be others?

8. Things that can precede "COAT": PEA coat... 

9. Pixar/Animated movies: COCO is a Pixar movie

10. Let me reconsider - words that go with another word:
- ___ GREEN: PEA green, LAWN green (golf course)
- ___ BROWN: could work with Charlie Brown?

11. Wait - these could all go before or after a common word:
- TENNIS: LAWN tennis? FIELD... no
- JACKET: FIELD jacket, PEA jacket? No, that's pea coat

12. Let me look at Tarantino again: 
- Django UNCHAINED
- Reservoir DOGS
- Pulp FICTION
- Jackie BROWN
This seems very strong!

13. Executive ___: 
- Executive DIRECTOR
- Executive CHEF (not CHIEF)
- Executive CHAIR (like chairman)
- Executive PRODUCER? HEAD?

14. Actually, let me think about ___ EXECUTIVE:
- CHIEF executive
- No...

15. Types of officers or positions with CHIEF:
- CHIEF of staff
- Fire CHIEF

16. Words that can follow "FIRE":
- CHIEF (fire chief)? No...

17. Hmm, let me think about ___ HOCKEY or similar sports:
- FIELD hockey
- ICE hockey...

18. Let me reconsider the Tarantino movies - that seems most solid:
BROWN (Jackie Brown), UNCHAINED (Django Unchained), DOGS (Reservoir Dogs), FICTION (Pulp Fiction)

This is my strongest guess. Let me go with this.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

CHEST, FIELD, CHIEF, HEAD, LAWN, PEA, GROUNDS, CHAIR, HAZEL, DIRECTOR, COCO, GREEN

Let me analyze these:

1. Colors/Eye colors: HAZEL, GREEN, BROWN (gone) - need more. Could CHEST be chestnut? 

2. Leadership positions: CHIEF, HEAD, CHAIR, DIRECTOR - these could all be leadership roles or titles
   - CHIEF (chief executive, chief of police)
   - HEAD (head of department)
   - CHAIR (chairman/chairperson)
   - DIRECTOR (director of a company)
   This seems strong!

3. Words that can precede COAT:

4. Let me think about compound words with a common word:
   - FIELD, LAWN, GROUNDS - these are all outdoor areas/surfaces
   - FIELD day, LAWN mower, GROUNDS keeper

5. Coffee-related: GROUNDS (coffee grounds), could others work?

6. Types of outdoor areas: FIELD, LAWN, GROUNDS... need a fourth. GREEN (village green, golf green)?
   - Actually GREEN could be a putting green
   - FIELD, LAWN, GROUNDS, GREEN - all outdoor grassy areas?

7. Coco Chanel? COCO could relate to fashion

8. ___ JACKET:
   - FIELD jacket
   - PEA jacket? (usually pea coat)
   - No...

9. Let me think about what can come before or after these words:
   - CHEST: treasure chest, chest hair, hope chest
   - PEA: pea soup, pea coat, pea shooter

10. Words + NUT:
    - CHEST + NUT = CHESTNUT
    - HAZEL + NUT = HAZELNUT
    - PEA + NUT = PEANUT
    - COCO + NUT = COCONUT
    This is it! All can precede NUT to make a word!

FIELD, CHIEF, HEAD, LAWN, GROUNDS, CHAIR, DIRECTOR, GREEN

Let me analyze these:

1. Leadership positions: CHIEF, HEAD, CHAIR, DIRECTOR
   - CHIEF (chief executive, chief of staff)
   - HEAD (head of department, headmaster)
   - CHAIR (chairman/chairperson)
   - DIRECTOR (director of a company/board)

Both of these groupings seem very strong. Let me decide which one to go with.

The leadership positions seem very clean:
- CHIEF executive officer
- HEAD of department
- CHAIR of the board
- DIRECTOR of operations

The outdoor areas also work:
- All can be grassy outdoor spaces
- FIELD, LAWN, GROUNDS, GREEN

I think the leadership positions might be the intended category since they're all titles/roles. But the outdoor areas are also very solid.

First, let me identify what each word could mean or relate to:

1. VOLUMETRIC - relating to volume measurement
2. MERIDA - Disney princess from Brave, also a city in Mexico/Spain
3. ARIEL - Disney princess from The Little Mermaid, also a font
4. SPLIT - gymnastics move, or to divide
5. ARIAL - a font
6. AREAL - relating to area
7. ANGULAR - relating to angles, or a web framework
8. ARABESQUE - a ballet position, also an ornamental design
9. GEORGIA - US state, also a font
10. LINEAR - relating to lines
11. VERDANA - a font

13. ROUNDOFF - a gymnastics move
14. TIANA - Disney princess from Princess and the Frog
15. AURORA - Disney princess from Sleeping Beauty
16. AERIAL - a gymnastics move, also relating to air

Let me look for categories:

**Fonts**: ARIAL, GEORGIA, VERDANA, IMPACT - these are all common computer fonts
- ARIEL could be confused with ARIAL but it's spelled differently

**Disney Princesses**: MERIDA, ARIEL, TIANA, AURORA - all Disney princesses

**Gymnastics moves**: SPLIT, ARABESQUE, ROUNDOFF, AERIAL - these are all gymnastics moves/positions

**Types of measurements or relating to dimensions**: VOLUMETRIC, AREAL, ANGULAR, LINEAR - these all relate to different types of measurements (volume, area, angle, line)

Let me verify:
- Fonts: ARIAL, GEORGIA, VERDANA, IMPACT ✓
- Disney Princesses: MERIDA, ARIEL, TIANA, AURORA ✓
- Gymnastics: SPLIT, ARABESQUE, ROUNDOFF, AERIAL ✓
- Measurement types: VOLUMETRIC, AREAL, ANGULAR, LINEAR ✓

This accounts for all 16 words perfectly!

Let me think about potential groupings:

1. **Types of bears**: POLAR (polar bear), BLACK (black bear), BROWN (brown bear), SUN (sun bear) - This seems like a strong connection! These are all types of bears.

2. **Hair colors**: BLONDE, BROWN, BLACK, LIGHT (light brown?) - Hmm, but BLACK and BROWN could fit with bears too.

3. **Kitchen tools/actions**: WHIP, WHISK, BEAT - these are all ways to mix things in cooking. Need a fourth... CREAM could be "to cream" as in creaming butter?

4. **_____ ale types**: PALE (pale ale), CREAM (cream ale), BROWN (brown ale)... need a fourth

5. **Words meaning "weak" or "not strong"**: FAINT, DIM, PALE, LIGHT - these could all describe something weak or not intense

6. **POOL types**: CAR POOL, WORD POOL? Not sure about this pattern

7. **_____ BEER types**: Let me think - PALE (ale), CREAM (cream ale), LIGHT (light beer), RICE (rice beer/lager)

Wait, let me reconsider:
- Types of bears: POLAR, BLACK, BROWN, SUN - very strong!
- Cooking actions to mix: WHIP, WHISK, BEAT, CREAM (as verbs) - strong!
- Weak/faint meanings: DIM, FAINT, PALE, LIGHT - these all can mean "not bright" or "weak"

POLAR (polar bear), BLACK (black bear), BROWN (brown bear), SUN (sun bear)

Let me reconsider my earlier groupings:

1. **Cooking actions to mix/aerate**: WHIP, WHISK, BEAT, CREAM - these are all verbs used in baking/cooking to mix or aerate ingredients. You whip cream, whisk eggs, beat batter, cream butter and sugar. This seems strong!

2. **Words meaning weak/not intense**: DIM, FAINT, PALE, LIGHT - these all can describe something that's not bright or intense. A dim light, faint sound, pale color, light touch.

3. **Types of ale/beer**: PALE (pale ale), CREAM (cream ale), LIGHT (light beer), RICE (rice lager)... but CREAM fits better with cooking verbs.

4. **_____ POOL**: WORD POOL, CAR POOL... not seeing a clear pattern

5. **Hair colors**: BLONDE, LIGHT (light brown?), not enough here

Let me think about what could go with WORD, BLONDE, RICE, POOL...

Could these all precede or follow a common word?
- WORD + POOL = WORD POOL
- BLONDE + ? 
- RICE + PUDDING, RICE + PAPER
- POOL + PARTY, POOL + TABLE

14. Let me reconsider compound words with a common prefix:

17. Types of exercise or walking styles:

18. Pay/salary increases:

19. Let me focus on the "nonsense" category since it seems strongest:

20. TV shows:

- Hmm...

21. Words that can follow "CRACKER":

22. Looking at FISH, HUNT, WALK, NAP:

Available words: CANDLE, ENGINE, BULB, HEAD, WING, SEAL, FLEECE, HOSE, EAR, NOSE, STIFF, CRAYON, ROB, CABIN, HONEYCOMB, STALK

Let me think about potential categories:

1. Body parts: HEAD, EAR, NOSE... but BULB could be part of this? (bulb of garlic? Or nose/ear as in body parts)

2. Things that can follow "WAX": CANDLE (wax candle), SEAL (wax seal), FIGURE? No... Let me think about WAX ___:
- WAX CANDLE
- WAX SEAL
- WAX FIGURE
- WAX MUSEUM

Wait, let me think about ___ WAX or things associated with wax:
- EAR (ear wax)
- CANDLE (candle wax)
- SEAL (wax seal)
- HONEYCOMB (beeswax from honeycomb)
- CRAYON (crayons contain wax)

3. Parts of an airplane: WING, CABIN, ENGINE, NOSE (nose of a plane)

4. Things that can come before a common word:
- CABIN, FLEECE... CABIN FEVER? FLEECE could be Golden Fleece
- HEAD, NOSE, EAR... could these go with something?

5. ___ LIGHT: CANDLE LIGHT? BULB (light bulb), HEAD (headlight)...

6. Let me think about "stiff" - STIFF could be slang for a dead body, or "stiff someone" meaning to not tip...

7. ROB - Robert? Or to steal?

Wait, let me reconsider airplane parts: WING, CABIN, ENGINE, NOSE - these are all parts of an airplane!

Let me also think about things related to WAX:
- EAR (ear wax)
- CANDLE (made of wax)
- SEAL (wax seal)
- CRAYON (contains wax)
- HONEYCOMB (beeswax)

That's 5 potential items, so I need to narrow it down.

Actually, let me think about ___ GOLDEN:
- GOLDEN FLEECE
- GOLDEN SEAL (herb)
- GOLDEN RETRIEVER?

Or things that can precede JACKET:
- FLEECE JACKET
- LIFE JACKET?

Let me think about verbs meaning "to cheat or swindle":
- STIFF (to stiff someone)
- FLEECE (to fleece someone)
- ROB (to rob)
- HOSE (to hose someone?)

Actually, yes! These could all mean to swindle/cheat someone:
- STIFF - to not pay/tip
- FLEECE - to swindle
- ROB - to steal from
- HOSE - slang for cheating someone

Let me verify the airplane parts: WING, CABIN, ENGINE, NOSE - yes, these are all parts of an airplane.

I think the airplane parts category is very strong. Let me go with that first.

WING - airplane wing
CABIN - airplane cabin
ENGINE - airplane engine  
NOSE - nose of the airplane

This seems like a solid category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
WING, CABIN, ENGINE, NOSE

Now let me work with the remaining 12 words:

Remaining words: CANDLE, BULB, HEAD, SEAL, FLEECE, HOSE, EAR, STIFF, CRAYON, ROB, HONEYCOMB, STALK

Let me reconsider my earlier theories:

1. Words meaning to cheat/swindle someone:
- STIFF - to not pay/tip someone
- FLEECE - to swindle someone
- ROB - to steal from someone
- HOSE - slang for cheating someone

This still looks strong!

2. Things associated with WAX:
- EAR (ear wax)
- CANDLE (made of wax)
- SEAL (wax seal)
- CRAYON (contains wax)
- HONEYCOMB (beeswax)

That's 5 items, so one doesn't fit or there's a different category.

3. Things that can follow a color or precede something:
- BULB - light bulb, tulip bulb
- HEAD - head of lettuce, blockhead

4. Let me think about STALK:
- STALK of celery
- To stalk someone (follow)
- CORN stalk

Wait, could there be a vegetable/plant connection?
- BULB (garlic bulb, tulip bulb)
- STALK (celery stalk)
- HEAD (head of lettuce, head of cabbage)
- EAR (ear of corn)

Yes! These are all ways to describe parts/units of vegetables!
- EAR of corn
- HEAD of lettuce/cabbage
- STALK of celery
- BULB of garlic

Let me compare confidence:
- Swindle words (STIFF, FLEECE, ROB, HOSE): Strong
- Vegetable units (EAR, HEAD, STALK, BULB): Also strong

I think the vegetable/produce measurement units is very clever and likely to be a Connections category. Let me go with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me reconsider my theories:

1. Words meaning to cheat/swindle someone:
- STIFF - to not pay/tip someone
- FLEECE - to swindle someone
- ROB - to steal from someone
- HOSE - slang for cheating someone

This still looks very strong!

2. Things associated with WAX:
- CANDLE (made of wax)
- SEAL (wax seal)
- CRAYON (contains wax)
- HONEYCOMB (beeswax)

This also has exactly 4 items now!

Both categories seem to have exactly 4 words each, which is perfect.

Let me verify the "swindle" category:
- STIFF: "He stiffed the waiter" - to not pay
- FLEECE: "They fleeced him out of his money" - to swindle
- ROB: "They robbed him" - to steal
- HOSE: "He got hosed" - to be cheated

And the WAX category:
- CANDLE: Candles are made of wax
- SEAL: Wax seals on letters
- CRAYON: Crayons are made with wax
- HONEYCOMB: Beeswax comes from honeycomb

Both are solid. I'll go with the swindle/cheat category since I've been thinking about it longer.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me list them out: SECRET, PERSONAL, BILL, DOLLAR, INNER, SOLDIER, POUND, WON, PRINCIPAL, STERLING, CRITICAL, PRIVATE, MAJOR, WING, NICKEL, KEY

Let me look for connections:

1. **Currency-related words:**
- DOLLAR (US currency)
- POUND (UK currency)
- WON (Korean currency)
- NICKEL (US coin, 5 cents)
- BILL (paper money)
- STERLING (British pound sterling)

2. **Military ranks:**
- PRIVATE (lowest rank)
- MAJOR (military rank)
- Could SOLDIER fit? Not a rank though.

3. **Words that can follow "KEY":**
- KEY + PRINCIPAL? No...
- Actually, let me think about what can precede a common word...

4. **Words that can precede "SCHOOL":**
- PRIVATE school
- Could work...

5. **Words meaning "important/essential":**
- KEY (key factor)
- CRITICAL (critical importance)
- MAJOR (major importance)
- PRINCIPAL (principal reason)

6. **Body parts or anatomy:**
- INNER (inner ear?)
- WING (chicken wing?)

7. **Words that can follow "BUFFALO":**
- BUFFALO BILL
- BUFFALO WING
- BUFFALO NICKEL (the coin!)
- BUFFALO SOLDIER (Bob Marley song, also historical term)

This seems like a strong connection! BILL, WING, NICKEL, SOLDIER - all can follow BUFFALO!

8. **"Private ___" or "___ private":**
- PRIVATE SOLDIER, PRIVATE BILL...

9. **STERLING connections:**
- POUND STERLING
- STERLING silver

10. **Words meaning "personal/confidential":**
- SECRET
- PERSONAL
- PRIVATE
- INNER (inner thoughts)

Let me verify the BUFFALO connection:
- BUFFALO BILL (famous Wild West figure) ✓
- BUFFALO WING (food) ✓
- BUFFALO NICKEL (US coin from 1913-1938) ✓
- BUFFALO SOLDIER (African American soldiers, also song) ✓

This seems very strong! Let me go with this guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: SECRET, PERSONAL, DOLLAR, INNER, POUND, WON, PRINCIPAL, STERLING, CRITICAL, PRIVATE, MAJOR, KEY

Let me look for connections again:

1. **Currency:**
- DOLLAR (US)
- POUND (UK)
- WON (Korean)
- STERLING (British pound sterling)

Wait, STERLING is part of "pound sterling" - so maybe it's not a standalone currency.

2. **Military ranks:**
- PRIVATE (lowest enlisted)
- MAJOR (officer rank)
- Hmm, only two here now.

3. **Words meaning "main/important":**
- KEY (key issue)
- CRITICAL (critical point)
- MAJOR (major factor)
- PRINCIPAL (principal concern)

This seems like a strong category! Words that mean "main" or "most important."

4. **Words that can precede a common word:**
- PERSONAL + ?
- PRIVATE + ?
- SECRET + ?
- INNER + ?

5. **___ CIRCLE:**
- INNER CIRCLE ✓
- Could others work?

6. **Words describing types of information/space:**
- SECRET
- PERSONAL
- PRIVATE
- INNER

These all relate to things that are not public or hidden/confidential.

7. **Currencies again:**
- DOLLAR
- POUND
- WON
- What's the fourth? STERLING? Or maybe these go with something else?

8. **Words that can follow SILVER:**
- SILVER DOLLAR ✓
- SILVER... STERLING? No, it's sterling silver.

Let me reconsider. Words meaning "primary/main/most important":
- KEY
- CRITICAL
- MAJOR
- PRINCIPAL

All of these can mean "most important" or "primary." This feels like a solid category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- POUND (UK currency)
- WON (Korean currency)
- STERLING (British pound sterling - but this seems redundant with POUND)

Hmm, maybe STERLING isn't about currency here.

2. **Words meaning private/confidential:**
- SECRET
- PERSONAL
- PRIVATE
- INNER (inner thoughts, inner feelings)

These all relate to things that are not shared publicly or are kept to oneself.

3. **Let me think about other connections:**
- STERLING could mean "excellent" (sterling reputation)
- WON could be past tense of "win"
- POUND could be a verb (to pound)
- DOLLAR could be... ?

4. **___ SIGN:**
- DOLLAR SIGN ✓
- POUND SIGN ✓
- What else?

5. **Words that can precede SPACE:**
- PERSONAL SPACE ✓
- INNER SPACE ✓
- Could work...

6. **Thinking about STERLING:**
- STERLING silver
- STERLING reputation
- Archer STERLING (from the show Archer)

7. **Words that can follow a name or word:**

These must be the final category. Let me figure out the connection:

1. **Currencies:** 
- DOLLAR (US currency)
- POUND (UK currency)
- WON (Korean currency)
- STERLING (British pound sterling)

But having both POUND and STERLING seems redundant if it's just currencies...

2. **Other meanings:**
- WON = past tense of "win"
- POUND = to hit repeatedly
- DOLLAR = currency
- STERLING = excellent quality

3. **Could they all follow or precede something?**
- SILVER DOLLAR ✓
- POUND... SILVER POUND? No.
- STERLING SILVER ✓ (wait, that's reversed)

4. **Names?**
- These could all be names or surnames
- Sterling (Archer's last name, Donald Sterling)
- Dollar (less common as a name)

5. **Wait - could these all relate to "SAND"?**
- SAND DOLLAR ✓ (sea creature)
- SAND... no

6. **What about adjectives meaning "excellent"?**
- STERLING (sterling work)
- Hmm, the others don't fit this.

Since these are the only 4 remaining, they must form a category. The most likely connection is currencies:
- DOLLAR (US)
- POUND (UK)
- WON (South Korea)
- STERLING (UK - pound sterling)

Or perhaps they can all precede or follow a common word. Let me think...

First, let me identify potential categories:

1. Words that could follow "DAY":
- LAUNCH (Launch Day)
- PREMIERE (Premiere Day? Not common)
- MOTHER (Mother's Day)
- SAINT VALENTINE (Valentine's Day)
- SAINT PATRICK (Saint Patrick's Day)
- PRESIDENT (President's Day)
- BURNS (Burns Day - Robert Burns Day in Scotland)
- BIRD (Bird Day? Not common)

Wait, let me think about "___ Day" more carefully:
- Mother's Day ✓
- Valentine's Day ✓
- Saint Patrick's Day ✓
- President's Day (or Presidents' Day) ✓
- Burns Day (Robert Burns Day) ✓

That's 5 potential "Day" words, so I need to narrow down.

2. Chess pieces:
- BISHOP ✓
- POPE? (No)
- Wait, chess has: King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn

3. Words that could precede a common word:
- BIRD, POPE, BISHOP, CLERGY MEMBER, MOTHER could all relate to religion or church hierarchy

4. Looking at religious figures/titles:
- POPE (Catholic leader)
- BISHOP (religious title)
- CLERGY MEMBER (religious)
- SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK (saints)

5. Let me think about "First ___":
- LAUNCH (first launch? not quite)
- PREMIERE (first showing)
- DEBUT (first appearance)
- INTRODUCTION (first meeting)
- BIRD (First Bird? Larry Bird?)

6. Wait - could these be things that can follow "LADY"?
- LADY BIRD (Lady Bird Johnson)
- LADY LORDE? (No)
- FIRST LADY? 

7. Let me think about "FIRST ___":
- FIRST LADY
- FIRST DEBUT? No
- FIRST INTRODUCTION? No

8. What about types of beginnings/starts:
- LAUNCH
- PREMIERE
- DEBUT
- INTRODUCTION

These all mean a first appearance or beginning! This seems strong.

9. Looking at what's left: M.L.B. PLAYER, LORDE, SAINT VALENTINE, POPE, BIRD, N.F.L. PLAYER, MOTHER, BISHOP, SAINT PATRICK, CLERGY MEMBER, BURNS, PRESIDENT

10. Could some of these be "names" that go with something?
- BIRD - Larry Bird
- BURNS - Ken Burns? George Burns?
- LORDE - the singer
- POPE - ?

11. Wait - what if these are all things that can precede "DAY"?
- Mother's Day
- President's Day (Presidents Day)
- Saint Valentine's Day (Valentine's Day)
- Saint Patrick's Day
- Burns Day (Robert Burns Night actually)

Let me reconsider. Four holidays/days:
- MOTHER (Mother's Day)
- PRESIDENT (Presidents' Day)
- SAINT VALENTINE (Valentine's Day)
- SAINT PATRICK (St. Patrick's Day)

This seems like a solid group of 4!

But wait, BURNS could also be Burns Night/Day.

Let me start with the "beginnings/firsts" category since it seems most certain:
LAUNCH, PREMIERE, DEBUT, INTRODUCTION - all words meaning a first appearance or introduction of something.

This seems like my strongest guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now let me work with the remaining 12 words:

LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, SAINT VALENTINE, POPE, BIRD, N.F.L. PLAYER, MOTHER, BISHOP, SAINT PATRICK, CLERGY MEMBER, BURNS, PRESIDENT

Let me look for patterns:

1. "___ Day" holidays:
- MOTHER (Mother's Day)
- PRESIDENT (Presidents' Day)
- SAINT VALENTINE (Valentine's Day)
- SAINT PATRICK (St. Patrick's Day)
- BURNS (Burns Night/Day - Scottish celebration)

That's 5 possibilities, so I need to narrow it down. The most common American holidays would be Mother's Day, Presidents' Day, Valentine's Day, and St. Patrick's Day.

2. Religious hierarchy/chess:
- POPE
- BISHOP
- CLERGY MEMBER
- These are religious figures

3. Let me think about what could connect other words:
- BIRD - Larry Bird (basketball player)
- LORDE - singer/artist
- BURNS - could be Ken Burns, George Burns
- M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER - types of athletes

4. Wait - what if some of these can precede or follow a common word?

Let me think about "Holy ___":
- Holy Mother
- Holy Pope? No
- Holy Bird? No

5. What about "___ Superior"?
- Mother Superior ✓

6. What about things that relate to "Our ___" or Catholic terminology?
- Our Lady
- Holy Father (Pope)
- Holy Mother

7. Let me reconsider M.L.B. PLAYER and N.F.L. PLAYER... these seem oddly specific. Could they connect to something?

8. Wait - could these be things that come before a specific word?
- BIRD (Bird watching? Bird song?)
- BURNS (Burns unit?)

9. Thinking about New Zealand - LORDE is from New Zealand. BIRD could relate to kiwi bird...

10. Let me think about "___ DAY" more carefully:
- Mother's Day ✓
- President's Day ✓  
- Valentine's Day (from Saint Valentine) ✓
- St. Patrick's Day (from Saint Patrick) ✓
- Burns Day/Night ✓

I think the safest "Day" group is: MOTHER, PRESIDENT, SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK

Let me go with this.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
MOTHER, PRESIDENT, SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK

Two down, two to go. Let me look at the remaining 8 words:

LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, POPE, BIRD, N.F.L. PLAYER, BISHOP, CLERGY MEMBER, BURNS

Let me find patterns:

1. Religious figures/titles:
- POPE
- BISHOP
- CLERGY MEMBER
- These are all religious positions

2. But that's only 3. What else could fit?
- LORDE sounds like "Lord" which is religious
- Could BIRD fit? No, not really religious.

3. Let me think about what connects M.L.B. PLAYER and N.F.L. PLAYER:
- Both are types of professional athletes
- Both are "_____ PLAYER"
- What other kinds of players could there be?

4. Wait - could these be things that can follow a word?
- RECORD (Record Player?)
- CD PLAYER?

5. Thinking about homophones or sound-alikes:
- LORDE sounds like "LORD"
- What if these are all homophones or near-homophones?

6. Let me think about Grammy winners or musicians:
- LORDE - singer
- BIRD - Charlie "Bird" Parker (jazz musician)
- BURNS - ?

7. What about "Cardinal"?
- Cardinal is a religious figure (like POPE, BISHOP)
- Cardinal is also a BIRD
- Cardinals are an M.L.B. team (St. Louis Cardinals)
- Cardinals are an N.F.L. team (Arizona Cardinals)

This could be it! Things that can follow "CARDINAL":
- POPE? No, that doesn't work with Cardinal
- Wait, let me reconsider...

8. Things that ARE Cardinals or relate to Cardinal:
- BIRD (cardinal is a type of bird)
- M.L.B. PLAYER (Cardinals baseball team)
- N.F.L. PLAYER (Cardinals football team)
- BISHOP? Cardinals are above bishops in church hierarchy
- CLERGY MEMBER? A cardinal is a clergy member

9. Wait - what if these are all types of Cardinals?
- Cardinal = BIRD
- Cardinal = CLERGY MEMBER (or religious title)
- St. Louis Cardinals = M.L.B. PLAYER
- Arizona Cardinals = N.F.L. PLAYER

That's 4! BIRD, CLERGY MEMBER, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER - all can be described as "CARDINAL"

This seems very strong!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

LORDE, POPE, BISHOP, BURNS

These must form the final category. Let me figure out what connects them:

1. LORDE - New Zealand singer (Ella Yelich-O'Connor)
2. POPE - Religious leader / could also be a name
3. BISHOP - Religious title / could also be a name
4. BURNS - Could be Robert Burns (Scottish poet) or a surname

What could connect these four?

- Could they all be surnames of famous people?
- LORDE is a stage name
- POPE could be a surname (Alexander Pope - English poet!)
- BISHOP could be a surname (Elizabeth Bishop - American poet!)
- BURNS - Robert Burns (Scottish poet!)

Wait! Are these all poets?
- Alexander Pope - famous English poet
- Elizabeth Bishop - famous American poet
- Robert Burns - famous Scottish poet
- LORDE - she's a singer/songwriter, but her lyrics are poetic...

Hmm, but LORDE is primarily known as a singer, not a poet traditionally.

Let me think of another connection:
- Could these all be names that sound like something else?
- LORDE sounds like "Lord"
- POPE is a religious title
- BISHOP is a religious title
- BURNS... burning?

What if they can all precede or follow a common word?

What about "Audre Lorde"? She was a famous poet/writer!
- Audre LORDE - poet
- Alexander POPE - poet
- Elizabeth BISHOP - poet
- Robert BURNS - poet

Yes! These are all surnames of famous poets!

This must be the answer: LORDE, POPE, BISHOP, BURNS are all surnames of famous poets.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Available words: SHAME, RACE, AKEEM, BAD, FOLEY, TUT TUT, COBRA, TUT, DONKEY, FLY, CAKE, DOLITTLE, ZIP, BARREL, KONG, TSK

Let me look for potential categories:

1. Eddie Murphy movies characters/roles:
- AKEEM (Coming to America - Prince Akeem)
- FOLEY (Beverly Hills Cop - Axel Foley)
- DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle)
- DONKEY (Shrek - he voiced Donkey)
This seems like a strong connection!

2. Sounds of disapproval:
- TSK (tsk tsk)
- TUT (tut tut) - wait, TUT TUT is also here
- SHAME (shame shame)
- These could be repeated sounds of disapproval

3. ___ KONG:
- DONKEY KONG (video game)
- KONG could be part of something else
- HONG KONG?

4. Things that can follow "KING":
- KING KONG
- KING COBRA
- KING TUT
- KING CAKE (Mardi Gras)
This could be a strong category!

5. Expressions doubled for disapproval:
- TUT TUT
- TSK TSK (but it's just TSK)
- SHAME SHAME
- Maybe these need to be doubled?

Wait, let me reconsider the KING ___ pattern:
- KING KONG
- KING COBRA
- KING TUT
- KING CAKE (traditional Mardi Gras cake)

But wait, TUT and TUT TUT are both there... Let me think about this differently.

Actually, looking more carefully:
- KING KONG
- KING COBRA
- KING TUT
- KING CAKE

But TUT TUT is a separate word from TUT. So TUT could go with KING TUT.

Let me also consider:
- BARREL RACE
- BARREL ROLL
- Things in a barrel?

ZIP could be:
- ZIP code
- ZIP line

FLY could be:
- BAR FLY
- FLY fishing

BAD could be:
- Michael Jackson's BAD
- BAD boy

Hmm, Eddie Murphy movies/characters is strong:
- AKEEM (Coming to America)
- FOLEY (Beverly Hills Cop - Axel Foley)
- DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle)
- DONKEY (Shrek)

But wait, if DONKEY is used for Eddie Murphy, then DONKEY KONG wouldn't work...

Let me reconsider. The KING ___ pattern seems very solid:
- KING KONG (movie)
- KING COBRA (snake)
- KING TUT (Egyptian pharaoh)
- KING CAKE (Mardi Gras tradition)

This leaves DONKEY for the Eddie Murphy category.

I'm fairly confident about KING ___ : KONG, COBRA, TUT, CAKE

Let me start with this guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now let me work with the remaining words.

Remaining words: SHAME, RACE, AKEEM, BAD, FOLEY, TUT TUT, DONKEY, FLY, DOLITTLE, ZIP, BARREL, TSK

Let me reconsider my categories:

1. Eddie Murphy movie characters/roles:
- AKEEM (Coming to America - Prince Akeem)
- FOLEY (Beverly Hills Cop - Axel Foley)
- DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle)
- DONKEY (Shrek - he voiced Donkey)
This still seems very strong!

2. Sounds/expressions of disapproval (often repeated):
- TUT TUT
- TSK (tsk tsk)
- SHAME (shame shame)
- What else? Maybe FOR SHAME?

3. ___ ROLL or BARREL ___:
- BARREL RACE
- BARREL ROLL

4. ZIP could be:
- Zero (zip, zilch)
- ZIP line
- ZIP code

5. BAD could be:
- Michael Jackson album
- BAD boy

6. FLY could be:
- BAR FLY
- FLY fishing
- On the fly

Let me think about what goes with BARREL:
- BARREL RACE (rodeo event)
- BARREL ROLL
- BARREL of monkeys

Hmm, RACE, ROLL... what about:
- Things that can follow a word?
- BARREL RACE, BARREL ROLL...

Actually, let me think about ___ RACE:
- BARREL RACE
- RAT RACE
- RACE car

Or things that go with "OF MONKEYS":
- BARREL of monkeys (game)

Let me focus on Eddie Murphy - this seems most solid:
AKEEM, FOLEY, DOLITTLE, DONKEY

All are characters Eddie Murphy played in movies.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: SHAME, RACE, BAD, TUT TUT, FLY, ZIP, BARREL, TSK

Let me look for patterns:

1. Sounds/expressions of disapproval:
- TUT TUT (disapproval sound)
- TSK (tsk tsk - disapproval)
- SHAME (for shame!, shame shame)
- What's the fourth? 

2. Things that mean zero/nothing:
- ZIP (zero)
- What else?

3. ___ OF MONKEYS or BARREL ___:
- BARREL of monkeys

4. Could these be things that go before or after a common word?

Let me think about what words can follow these:
- BAD boy, BAD apple, BAD blood
- FLY fishing, FLY ball
- RACE car, RACE track
- ZIP code, ZIP line

What about words that can precede a common word?
- BARREL roll, BARREL race
- FLY ball, FLY fishing

Hmm, let me think about "_____ BOY":
- BAD BOY
- FLY BOY
- Could RACE BOY work? Not really.

What about Michael Jackson songs/albums?
- BAD (album)
- Could others be MJ related?

Let me think about expressions of disapproval that are often repeated:
- TUT TUT
- TSK TSK (but it's just TSK)
- SHAME SHAME (for shame)
- FOR SHAME

Wait, what if these are all words that can be doubled?
- TUT TUT (already doubled)
- TSK TSK
- SHAME SHAME (shame on you, repeated)

Hmm, but TUT TUT is already the doubled form...

Let me think differently. What if they're all interjections or exclamations?
- TUT TUT
- TSK
- SHAME (for shame!)
- What else? FLY? BAD? ZIP?

Actually, what about ___ RACE:
- BARREL RACE (rodeo event)
- RAT RACE
- Could others work?

Or BARREL ___:
- BARREL RACE
- BARREL ROLL

What about things associated with "HOUSE"?
- FLY (house fly)
- BAD (bad house?)

Let me think about "OF LAUGHS" or "OF FUN":
- BARREL of laughs
- BARREL of fun
- BARREL of monkeys

What if these go with a common word like "ROLL"?
- BARREL ROLL
- What else?

Let me reconsider. Words remaining: SHAME, RACE, BAD, TUT TUT, FLY, ZIP, BARREL, TSK

Could these be things that describe "nothing" or "zero"?
- ZIP (zero)
- What else means nothing?

Or NASCAR/racing related?
- RACE
- BARREL (barrel roll?)

Hmm, let me think about sounds of disapproval more carefully:
- TUT TUT - disapproval
- TSK - disapproval (tsk tsk)
- SHAME - disapproval (shame on you, for shame)
- BAD - disapproval (bad! bad dog!)

This could be it! All are things you say to express disapproval:
TUT TUT, TSK, SHAME, BAD

2. Things associated with speed?
- RACE (fast)
- FLY (move quickly)

- RACE (to race somewhere)
- FLY (to fly down the road)

First, let me identify potential categories:

1. **Knots**: SHEEPSHANK, BEND, HITCH, BOWLINE - these are all types of knots used in sailing/climbing
   - Sheepshank is a knot
   - Bowline is a famous knot
   - Hitch is a type of knot (like clove hitch)
   - Bend is a type of knot (like sheet bend)

2. **Track and field events**: POLE (vault), HURDLE, HAMMER (throw), BATON (relay) - these could all be track and field related
   - Pole vault
   - Hurdle race
   - Hammer throw
   - Baton (relay race)

3. **Nonsense/Rubbish synonyms**: CROCK, BUNK, HOGWASH, HORSEFEATHERS - all mean nonsense
   - "That's a crock" (of something)
   - "That's bunk"
   - "That's hogwash"
   - "That's horsefeathers"

4. **Devil-related terms**: PITCHFORK, HORNS, TAIL, GOATEE - things associated with the devil
   - Devil carries a pitchfork
   - Devil has horns
   - Devil has a tail
   - Devil often depicted with a goatee

Let me verify these groupings:
- Knots: SHEEPSHANK, BEND, HITCH, BOWLINE ✓
- Nonsense words: CROCK, BUNK, HOGWASH, HORSEFEATHERS ✓
- Devil imagery: PITCHFORK, HORNS, TAIL, GOATEE ✓
- Track &amp; field: POLE, HURDLE, HAMMER, BATON ✓

Three down, one to go. The remaining 4 words are:
