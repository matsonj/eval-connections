Looking at the words:
BUMPER, ROLLER, FERRIS, PEE-WEE, BABY, MERRY, DUFFEL, BRIGHT, BOUNCY, BUGGY, CARRY-ON, SUNNY, HEATHER, RUBBER, INDIANA, HARD-SHELL

Potential categories I can identify:

1. <b>Types of luggage/bags</b>: DUFFEL, CARRY-ON, HARD-SHELL... and maybe RUBBER? No, that doesn't work well.

2. <b>___ wheel</b> words: FERRIS (wheel), ROLLER (?), BUMPER (?), MERRY (go round - not wheel)

3. <b>Adjectives describing disposition/personality</b>: SUNNY, BRIGHT, BOUNCY, MERRY - these all can describe a cheerful personality

4. <b>Types of balls or things that bounce</b>: BOUNCY, RUBBER, BUMPER... hmm

5. <b>Words that can precede "ball"</b>: BOUNCY (ball), RUBBER (ball), BUMPER (ball?)... 

6. <b>Famous people named ___</b>: PEE-WEE (Herman), HEATHER (common name), INDIANA (Jones), FERRIS (Bueller)

Wait, let me reconsider the "famous ___" pattern:
&bull; PEE-WEE Herman (comedian/character)
&bull; FERRIS Bueller (movie character)
&bull; INDIANA Jones (movie character)
&bull; HEATHER... Heather Locklear? Or could it be another pattern?

Actually, thinking about movies/characters:
&bull; FERRIS Bueller's Day Off
&bull; INDIANA Jones
&bull; PEE-WEE Herman
&bull; HEATHER - from the movie "Heathers"?

Let me think about luggage types:
&bull; DUFFEL (bag)
&bull; CARRY-ON (bag)
&bull; HARD-SHELL (suitcase)
&bull; ROLLER (suitcase/bag)

That seems very strong!

And for cheerful disposition:
&bull; SUNNY (disposition)
&bull; BRIGHT (personality)
&bull; BOUNCY (personality)
&bull; MERRY (mood)

Let me also consider:
&bull; BABY, BUGGY - baby buggy?
&bull; BUMPER - bumper cars?

I think my strongest guess is the luggage category: DUFFEL, CARRY-ON, HARD-SHELL, ROLLER</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
DUFFEL, CARRY-ON, HARD-SHELL, ROLLER

Now I have 8 words remaining:
BUMPER, FERRIS, PEE-WEE, BABY, BRIGHT, BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, INDIANA

Wait, I notice BRIGHT was in my last guess. Let me recount the remaining words:
BUMPER, FERRIS, PEE-WEE, BABY, BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, INDIANA

That's 8 words, which means 2 groups of 4 remain.

Let me think about possible categories:

1. <b>Famous characters (first names)</b>:
&bull; PEE-WEE (Herman - comedian/character)
&bull; FERRIS (Bueller - from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off")
&bull; INDIANA (Jones - from Indiana Jones movies)
&bull; BABY (from "Dirty Dancing" - "Nobody puts Baby in a corner")
or
&bull; HEATHER (from "Heathers")

2. <b>Types/styles related to something</b>:
&bull; BUMPER (bumper cars, bumper sticker)
&bull; BUGGY (baby buggy, dune buggy)
&bull; RUBBER (rubber duck, rubber band)
&bull; HEATHER (heather gray - a color)

Wait, could these be types of things?
&bull; BUMPER crop/sticker/cars
&bull; RUBBER duck/band/stamp
&bull; BABY buggy/powder/blues
&bull; BUGGY whip/ride

Or words that can precede a common word?

Let me think about "_____ gray":
&bull; HEATHER gray (color)
&bull; Could others be colors or shades?

Actually, thinking about movie characters again:
&bull; FERRIS Bueller
&bull; INDIANA Jones  
&bull; PEE-WEE Herman
&bull; BABY (from Dirty Dancing)

This seems very strong as they're all iconic movie characters known by their first names!

The remaining would be:
BUMPER, BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER

What could connect these? 
&bull; HEATHER (a type of plant/color)
&bull; RUBBER (material)
&bull; BUMPER (car part)
&bull; BUGGY (vehicle)

Hmm, or could they all precede "BALL"?
&bull; RUBBER ball
&bull; BUMPER ball? (those inflatable things you wear)
&bull; No, not quite working.

I'm most confident in the movie characters group.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

That means my movie character theory was wrong, or at least not the right combination.

Remaining 8 words:
BUMPER, FERRIS, PEE-WEE, BABY, BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, INDIANA

Let me reconsider. If those four aren't all movie characters, maybe the grouping is different.

Let me think about what else these could be:

<b>Words that can precede "BALL":</b>
&bull; RUBBER ball
&bull; BUMPER ball (those zorb-like inflatable balls)
&bull; Could others work? BABY ball? BUGGY ball? Doesn't seem right.

<b>Words that can follow a common word:</b>

Could these be "_____ DUCK"?
&bull; RUBBER duck
&bull; Could others be ducks? Not really.

What about different patterns:

<b>League/team names or sports:</b>
&bull; PEE-WEE (Pee-Wee league - youth sports)
&bull; RUBBER (rubber match - final game in a series)
&bull; Could BUMPER be related? Bumper pool?
&bull; BABY (baby pool?)

<b>Types of crops or harvest-related:</b>
&bull; BUMPER crop (large harvest)
&bull; RUBBER (rubber tree/plantation)
&bull; HEATHER (a plant)
&bull; BABY (baby vegetables?)

Actually, BUMPER crop is a strong phrase. Let me think about what else could be "_____ crop":
&bull; BUMPER crop
&bull; Could others work?

Or maybe these are all adjectives/words that describe size or type:
&bull; PEE-WEE (small)
&bull; BABY (small)
&bull; BUMPER (large, as in bumper crop)
&bull; RUBBER (material type)

Wait! Words that mean SMALL or describing youth levels:
&bull; PEE-WEE (youth sports level)
&bull; BABY (infant level)
&bull; Could BUGGY relate? Baby buggy?

Let me think about sports/league divisions:
&bull; PEE-WEE league
&bull; Could RUBBER match fit?

Or what about types of "_____ MATCH":
&bull; RUBBER match (deciding game)
&bull; BUMPER ... no

Let me try: BUMPER, HEATHER, RUBBER, BABY - types of materials or textures? No...

Actually, could they all be types of something in sports/games:
&bull; RUBBER match
&bull; BUMPER pool
&bull; PEE-WEE league
&bull; BABY pool?

I'm going to try grouping words related to sports terms/phrases:

I need to be more careful.

Remaining 8 words:
BUMPER, FERRIS, PEE-WEE, BABY, BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, INDIANA

Let me think more systematically about what could connect exactly 4 of these.

Let me consider compound words or phrases more carefully:

<b>Words that can precede "BLUE":</b>
&bull; BABY blue (color)
&bull; HEATHER blue? No, it's heather gray
&bull; RUBBER... no
&bull; INDIANA... no

<b>Words that precede common words:</b>

What about "_____-GO-ROUND" or carnival rides?
&bull; MERRY-go-round (already used)
&bull; Could any of these work? No.

Let me think about <b>famous people's first names</b> differently:
&bull; FERRIS (Bueller)
&bull; INDIANA (Jones)
&bull; HEATHER (Locklear, Graham, etc. - famous Heathers)
&bull; BABY (Spice - Baby Spice from Spice Girls!)

Or wait, could they be Spice Girls?
&bull; BABY Spice
&bull; Could others be? GINGER Spice... but I don't have GINGER
&bull; SPORTY, SCARY, POSH... none of these are here

Hmm, what about <b>types of carriages or vehicles:</b>
&bull; BUGGY (baby buggy, dune buggy)
&bull; BABY (baby carriage)
&bull; Could RUBBER buggy? No...

<b>Words meaning LARGE/ABUNDANT:</b>
&bull; BUMPER (as in bumper crop - exceptionally large)
&bull; Could others mean large? Not really.

Let me think about <b>HEATHER</b> specifically:
&bull; Heather gray (color)
&bull; Heather (plant)
&bull; Heather (name)

What if these are all <b>types of gray/colors:</b>
&bull; HEATHER gray
&bull; RUBBER... no
&bull; BABY blue is a color, but not gray

<b>Words that can be types of pools:</b>
&bull; BABY pool
&bull; BUMPER pool (a game)
&bull; RUBBER pool? No
&bull; Could BUGGY pool? No

Wait! Let me reconsider <b>BUGGY</b>:
&bull; BABY buggy
&bull; DUNE buggy
&bull; BUGGY whip

And <b>RUBBER:</b>
&bull; RUBBER band
&bull; RUBBER duck
&bull; RUBBER match

Could these be words that go with BAND?
&bull; RUBBER band
&bull; BABY band? No
&bull; BUMPER... no

Let me try thinking: <b>Words that precede BLUES:</b>
&bull; BABY blues (eye color or sadness)
&bull; HEATHER... no
&bull; RUBBER... no
&bull; INDIANA... no

I'm going to try: BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, BUMPER - maybe these are all adjectives or materials?

Actually wait - could these be <b>basketball-related terms or players:</b>
&bull; RUBBER (rubber match)
&bull; INDIANA (Pacers)
&bull; Could be state teams?

Let me try: <b>State/place-based:</b>
&bull; INDIANA (state)
&bull; Could others be states or places? FERRIS (Texas)? No...

I'll try: BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, BUMPER</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining 8 words:
BUMPER, FERRIS, PEE-WEE, BABY, BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, INDIANA

I've tried:
1. FERRIS, INDIANA, PEE-WEE, BABY (movie characters - incorrect)
2. BUMPER, PEE-WEE, RUBBER, BABY (incorrect)
3. BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, BUMPER (incorrect)

So there are 2 groups of 4 remaining. Let me think about what I haven't tried.

Let me think about what connects words in a different way:

<b>Could these be words that follow a specific word?</b>

What about "_____ Herman":
&bull; PEE-WEE Herman (comedian)
&bull; Could others be ___ Herman? Probably not all 4.

What about compound words with a common second part?

<b>Words that can precede CAKE:</b>
&bull; RUBBER... no
&bull; BABY cake? No
&bull; BUMPER... no

<b>Words associated with childhood/kids:</b>
&bull; PEE-WEE (youth sports)
&bull; BABY (infant)
&bull; BUGGY (baby buggy)
&bull; RUBBER (rubber ducky?)

Let me try: PEE-WEE, BABY, BUGGY, RUBBER

Actually, wait. Let me think about <b>nicknames or diminutives</b>:
&bull; PEE-WEE (small)
&bull; BABY (small/young)
&bull; BUGGY (?)
&bull; Could these all be nicknames?

Or what about <b>words that can describe someone small:</b>
&bull; PEE-WEE
&bull; BABY

Let me reconsider the remaining words and think about NYT Connections patterns:

Could there be a wordplay element? Like words that sound like something else?

<b>Words that rhyme with or sound like days/months:</b>
&bull; No clear pattern

<b>Words related to textures or materials:</b>
&bull; RUBBER (material)
&bull; HEATHER (fabric texture)
&bull; BUMPER (?)
&bull; BUGGY (?)

<b>Words that can be adjectives describing a crop/harvest:</b>
&bull; BUMPER crop (large)
&bull; BABY vegetables (small/young)
&bull; Could others work?

Let me think about <b>proper nouns - first names of famous people:</b>
&bull; FERRIS Bueller
&bull; INDIANA Jones
&bull; HEATHER (Locklear, Graham)
&bull; RUBBER... no, not a name

Could it be:
&bull; FERRIS
&bull; INDIANA  
&bull; HEATHER
&bull; BUGGY? (or BABY?)

Actually, let me think: BUGGY could be Bugsy (like Bugsy Malone or Bugsy Siegel)?

Let me try: FERRIS, INDIANA, HEATHER, BUGGY

Wait, or could BUGGY be a nickname? And these are all famous first names/nicknames:
&bull; FERRIS (Bueller)
&bull; INDIANA (Jones)
&bull; HEATHER (famous name)
&bull; PEE-WEE (Herman)

But I already tried FERRIS, INDIANA, PEE-WEE, BABY and it was wrong.

So maybe it's: FERRIS, INDIANA, HEATHER, BUGGY

That would leave: BUMPER, PEE-WEE, BABY, RUBBER

What would connect BUMPER, PEE-WEE, BABY, RUBBER?
&bull; All can be adjectives describing size or type?
&bull; BUMPER (large, as in bumper crop)
&bull; PEE-WEE (very small)
&bull; BABY (small)
&bull; RUBBER (?)

Hmm, not quite.

Let me reconsider the patterns:

1. Religious titles/figures: POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, BISHOP, SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK - still 5, need to find the right 4

2. Looking at potential compound words or phrases:
   - BIRD - Lady Bird Johnson (First Lady)
   - BURNS - Robert Burns (poet)
   - LORDE - Lorde (singer)
   
Wait, could these be people who go by one name or have "FIRST ___" in their title?

Actually, let me think about Catholic/Christian titles that could precede a name:
&bull; POPE (Pope Francis)
&bull; SAINT (Saint Valentine, Saint Patrick)
&bull; MOTHER (Mother Teresa)
&bull; BISHOP (Bishop Desmond Tutu)

These are all religious titles that come before a person's name!

The remaining would be:
&bull; BIRD, LORDE, BURNS, N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER, CLERGY MEMBER, SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK, PRESIDENT

Hmm, but SAINT VALENTINE and SAINT PATRICK already have SAINT in them...

Let me reconsider: titles that go before names:
&bull; PRESIDENT (President Lincoln)
&bull; POPE (Pope John Paul)
&bull; MOTHER (Mother Teresa)
&bull; BISHOP (Bishop Tutu)

&bull; BIRD - Larry Bird (basketball player)
&bull; BURNS - Larry Burns? Or could this be related to George Burns?

Actually, thinking about it:
&bull; BIRD - Larry Bird
&bull; LORDE - ? 
&bull; POPE - ? 
&bull; BURNS - ?

Or maybe these are all things that can follow a first name:
&bull; LARRY BIRD
&bull; POPE (Pope Larry?)
&bull; Wait...

Let me reconsider: Could these be chess pieces or positions?
&bull; BISHOP - chess piece
&bull; Hmm, no ROOK or KNIGHT

What if BIRD, LORDE, BURNS, and one more are all famous people's last names or stage names?
&bull; BIRD - Larry Bird / Charlie Parker (Bird)
&bull; LORDE - the singer Lorde
&bull; BURNS - George Burns / Robert Burns

Could POPE be a last name? Yes! There are people with the last name Pope.

Let me try: BIRD, LORDE, BURNS, POPE - these could all be surnames or stage names of famous people.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

BIRD, LORDE, BURNS, N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, BISHOP

Let me think more carefully. I've been wrong about two groups now.

Looking at the structure:
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER
&bull; BISHOP (which is a type of clergy)

Could there be a pattern where BISHOP goes with N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER, and CLERGY MEMBER?

Wait, what if these are all things that can come after a specific word?

Let me think about "CHESS ___":
&bull; BISHOP is a chess piece
&bull; Hmm, no other chess pieces visible

What about things that could follow "LARRY"?
&bull; LARRY BIRD (famous basketball player)
&bull; LARRY POPE (CEO?)
&bull; LARRY BURNS (character from The Simpsons)
&bull; LARRY LORDE? (doesn't seem right)

Or maybe these can all follow "CARDINAL"?
&bull; CARDINAL BISHOP (rank in Catholic Church)
&bull; Hmm, Cardinals play in NFL and MLB...

Wait! CARDINAL!
&bull; CARDINAL (bird)
&bull; CARDINAL (M.L.B. player - St. Louis Cardinals)
&bull; CARDINAL (N.F.L. player - Arizona Cardinals)  
&bull; CARDINAL (clergy member/religious rank)

So: BIRD, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, CLERGY MEMBER could all be preceded by "CARDINAL"!

A cardinal is a type of bird, a Cardinals player in MLB, a Cardinals player in NFL, and a Cardinal is a high-ranking clergy member!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
BIRD, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, CLERGY MEMBER

Could these all be:

- 

Wait, let me think about what specific connection they might have.

Could they all precede a common word?

Or could they all be related to a specific category like:
&bull; Chess pieces? BISHOP is a chess piece, but LORDE, BURNS, POPE aren't
- 

Let me think about "LORD":
&bull; LORDE is close to LORD
&bull; LORD BISHOP (a title for bishops in the Church of England)
&bull; Hmm...

Actually, wait - could these all be titles or forms related to "LORD"?
&bull; LORDE → LORD (the singer's stage name is a play on "Lord")
&bull; BISHOP → LORD BISHOP
&bull; POPE → could be related?
&bull; BURNS → ?

Or maybe they can all follow a word like "RANKING" or relate to hierarchy?

First, let me identify potential categories:

<b>Camera brands:</b>
&bull; HASSELBLAD (Swedish camera manufacturer)
&bull; FUJIFILM (Japanese camera/film company)
&bull; OLYMPUS (Japanese camera company)
&bull; POLAROID (Instant camera brand)

This looks like a strong group of 4 camera manufacturers.

<b>Things associated with Italian cities:</b>
&bull; BOLOGNESE (Bologna - sauce)
&bull; VENETIAN (Venice - style/blinds)
&bull; PARMESAN (Parma - cheese)
&bull; NEAPOLITAN (Naples - ice cream)

These are all adjectives derived from Italian city names.

<b>Things at a stadium/sports venue:</b>
&bull; SCOREBOARD (displays score)
&bull; JUMBOTRON (large screen)
&bull; KISSCAM (camera feature at games)
&bull; SKYBOX (luxury seating)
&bull; ASTROTURF (artificial grass)

This has 5 items, so I need to narrow it down.

<b>Other words:</b>
&bull; CREAMSICLE (ice cream treat)
&bull; JOURNEYMAN (experienced worker)
&bull; RUSHMORE (Mount Rushmore)

Let me reconsider. ASTROTURF could be artificial/fake things, but that doesn't help much.

Actually, looking more carefully:
&bull; ASTROTURF, SCOREBOARD, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, SKYBOX are all stadium-related

But that's 5 words. Let me think which one doesn't belong or if there's another pattern.

Wait - could some of these be related to "fake" or "artificial"? ASTROTURF is fake grass, CREAMSICLE could be artificial orange...

Let me reconsider NEAPOLITAN - it's also an ice cream flavor like CREAMSICLE.

Actually, I'm most confident about the camera brands group:
HASSELBLAD, FUJIFILM, OLYMPUS, POLAROID

Let me start with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me reconsider the remaining groups:

&bull; BOLOGNESE (Bologna - sauce)
&bull; VENETIAN (Venice - style/blinds)
&bull; PARMESAN (Parma - cheese)
&bull; NEAPOLITAN (Naples - ice cream)

This still looks very strong - all are adjectives derived from Italian city names.

<b>Stadium/Sports venue items:</b>
&bull; SCOREBOARD (displays score)
&bull; JUMBOTRON (large screen)
&bull; KISSCAM (camera feature at games)
&bull; SKYBOX (luxury seating)
&bull; ASTROTURF (artificial grass)

That's still 5 items. Let me think which one might belong elsewhere.

<b>Remaining words:</b>
&bull; CREAMSICLE (ice cream treat)
&bull; JOURNEYMAN (experienced worker)
&bull; RUSHMORE (Mount Rushmore)

Hmm, could there be a pattern with Mount RUSHMORE? Is JOURNEYMAN related to something? 

Wait - could some of these be movies or famous works? "Rushmore" is a Wes Anderson film. "The Journeyman" could be a film...

Let me think about other patterns. Could ASTROTURF fit elsewhere? CREAMSICLE is orange and white... VENETIAN blinds...

&bull; SCOREBOARD (displays score)
&bull; JUMBOTRON (large screen)
&bull; KISSCAM (camera feature at games)
&bull; SKYBOX (luxury seating)

&bull; RUSHMORE (Mount Rushmore monument)

Let me think about alternative connections:

Could these be compound words with a pattern? 
&bull; ASTROTURF = ASTRO + TURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE = CREAM + SICLE (icicle)
&bull; SCOREBOARD = SCORE + BOARD
&bull; JUMBOTRON = JUMBO + TRON
&bull; KISSCAM = KISS + CAM
&bull; SKYBOX = SKY + BOX

Hmm, could there be a pattern where the second part or first part relates to something?

Wait - could some of these be related to colors or visual patterns?
&bull; CREAMSICLE (orange and white)
&bull; ASTROTURF (fake/artificial green)

Or maybe famous films/works:
&bull; RUSHMORE (Wes Anderson film)
&bull; JOURNEYMAN (could be a film)

Let me think about "BILL MURRAY movies" or Wes Anderson films... but that seems too specific.

Actually, let me reconsider: Could ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE, JOURNEYMAN, and RUSHMORE share something? They all could be described with another word pattern...

I think the safest bet is still the stadium group, but I need to pick 4 of the 5. Let me go with the most obvious stadium fixtures:

Let me reconsider the 8 remaining words:
ASTROTURF, SCOREBOARD, CREAMSICLE, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, SKYBOX

If the stadium group isn't SCOREBOARD, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, SKYBOX, then maybe one of those belongs elsewhere and ASTROTURF is part of the stadium group instead?

Let me think about other patterns:

Could there be a "____MAN" pattern or compound word pattern?
&bull; JOURNEYMAN

What about films or pop culture references?
&bull; RUSHMORE (Wes Anderson film, 1998)

Wait, let me think about Bill Murray movies or Wes Anderson films:
&bull; RUSHMORE (Bill Murray film)
&bull; Could any others be Bill Murray films?

Or maybe there's a "fake/artificial" theme:
&bull; ASTROTURF (fake grass)
&bull; CREAMSICLE (artificial flavoring?)

Let me think about orange things or striped things:
&bull; CREAMSICLE (orange and white)
&bull; ASTROTURF (could be any color but typically green)

Hmm, what if there's a pattern with words that can follow or precede a certain word?

What about things that are "fake" or "mock" or "artificial"?
&bull; ASTROTURF (artificial turf)

Or compound words where both parts are independent words?
&bull; ASTROTURF (not really - "astro" isn't a standalone common word for this context)
&bull; SCOREBOARD (SCORE + BOARD)
&bull; CREAMSICLE (CREAM + icicle sound)
&bull; JUMBOTRON (JUMBO + tron)
&bull; KISSCAM (KISS + CAM)
&bull; JOURNEYMAN (JOURNEY + MAN)
&bull; SKYBOX (SKY + BOX)

Let me try a different approach: Maybe ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE, JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE form a group?

&bull; MOUNT RUSHMORE (yes!)

Could there be a Wes Anderson film connection?
&bull; RUSHMORE (definitely a Wes Anderson film)

&bull; Could CREAMSICLE, JULIUS (not here), COUNTY (not here)...

Wait! What if these can all be preceded by a color or specific word?

Let me think about "KISS":
&bull; KISSCAM

&bull; SCOREBOARD (all sports)
&bull; JUMBOTRON (all sports)
&bull; KISSCAM (all sports)
&bull; SKYBOX (all sports)
&bull; ASTROTURF (football/soccer)

Let me consider potential categories:

1. Words meaning "nonsense" or "lies":
&bull; BALONEY (nonsense)
&bull; BUNK (nonsense/bunk beds)
&bull; RUBBISH (nonsense/garbage)
&bull; BULL (short for bullshit, nonsense)

2. Card game actions or poker terms:

&bull; CALL would fit but not here

3. Actions/Verbs:
&bull; HUNT
&bull; HIKE
&bull; WALK
&bull; NAP
&bull; PEEL
&bull; RAISE
&bull; CRANK

4. Things that can follow "AUSTIN":
&bull; POWERS (Austin Powers)
&bull; Could there be others?

5. Things with "JACK":
&bull; JACK (by itself)
&bull; Could be part of compound words

6. Let me think about compound words or phrases:
&bull; FISH could be part of many compounds
&bull; TAIL could be part of many compounds
&bull; PEEL could be part of many compounds

7. Austin ___ (Famous Austins):
&bull; POWERS (Austin Powers)
&bull; Could ARCHER be Sterling Archer? No, that's Sterling.

8. Wait, let me reconsider - things that can come before "JACK":
&bull; CRANK (crankjack? no, crankshaft)
&bull; LUMBER (lumberjack)

9. Or things that come after "JACK":
&bull; FISH (no)
&bull; POT (jackpot)

10. Let me think about "___ RAISE":
&bull; RAISE could combine with others

11. Compound words with JACK:
&bull; JACK + POT = JACKPOT
&bull; JACK + KNIFE = JACKKNIFE
&bull; LUMBER + JACK = LUMBERJACK
&bull; FLAPJACK, BLACKJACK

12. What about things that go with TAIL:
&bull; FISH + TAIL = FISHTAIL
&bull; Could others work?

13. Let me reconsider types of exercises or movements:
&bull; HIKE
&bull; WALK
&bull; CRANK (crank up?)
&bull; RAISE (raise up?)

14. Card game related - types of raises or bets:
&bull; RAISE
&bull; CALL (not here)
&bull; CHECK (not here)

Let me start with my strongest hypothesis - words meaning nonsense/lies:
BALONEY, BUNK, RUBBISH, BULL

These all are slang terms for nonsense or lies.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

  - JACK + POT = JACKPOT
  - JACK + RABBIT = JACKRABBIT

3. Let me think about compound words with these:
&bull; POWER + WALK = POWERWALK
&bull; POWER + NAP = POWERNAP
&bull; POWER + HUNT = POWERHUNT (not common)
&bull; POWER + RAISE = POWERRAISE (poker term maybe?)

4. Wait, what about "POWER ___":
&bull; POWERS could be part of "Austin Powers"
&bull; POWER + WALK = POWERWALK
&bull; POWER + NAP = POWERNAP
&bull; POWER + PLAY = POWERPLAY (not here)

5. Let me think about "___ NAP":
&bull; POWER + NAP = POWERNAP
&bull; CAT + NAP = CATNAP
&bull; KID + NAP = KIDNAP!

6. This is interesting - "___NAP":
&bull; CATNAP (CAT not here)
&bull; KIDNAP (KID not here)
&bull; POWERNAP (POWER... but it's POWERS)

7. What about card game terms:
&bull; RAISE (poker action)
&bull; FISH (Go Fish game)
&bull; HUNT (scavenger hunt? treasure hunt?)
&bull; JACK (playing card)

8. Playing cards:
&bull; JACK (face card)
&bull; Could others be card-related?

9. Let me think about TV shows or famous names:
&bull; ARCHER (TV show)
&bull; POWERS (Austin Powers, or Jessica Jones character Kilgrave's ability)
&bull; HUNT (Hunt for Red October? Ethan Hunt?)

10. Activities/Actions that are compound words:
&bull; TREASURE HUNT
&bull; SCAVENGER HUNT
&bull; SNIPE HUNT
&bull; WITCH HUNT

11. "___HUNT":
&bull; WITCH HUNT (WITCH not here)
&bull; TREASURE HUNT (TREASURE not here)

12. Let me reconsider - things that can come before WALK:
&bull; POWER + WALK = POWERWALK
&bull; CAKE + WALK = CAKEWALK (CAKE not here)
&bull; Could FISH work? FISHWALK? No.
&bull; BOARD + WALK = BOARDWALK (BOARD not here)

13. Types of card games or card terms:
&bull; FISH (Go Fish)
&bull; JACK (playing card)
&bull; RAISE (poker action)
&bull; CRANK (not a card term I know)

14. Let me think about "POWER___" or "___POWER":
&bull; If it's POWERS without the S, could work with:
&bull; POWER NAP
&bull; POWER WALK
&bull; POWER RAISE (poker)
&bull; POWER HIKE?

Actually, let me think about words that can follow POWER (using POWERS as POWER):
&bull; POWER NAP
&bull; POWER WALK  
&bull; POWER PLAY (not here)
&bull; POWER RANGER (not here)

Hmm, but it says POWERS, not POWER. Let me reconsider.

15. Famous Archers or people with these names:
&bull; ARCHER (Sterling Archer, or the TV show)
&bull; HUNT (Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible)
&bull; PEEL (Emma Peel from The Avengers)
&bull; POWERS (Austin Powers)

These are all spy/secret agent characters!
&bull; Sterling Archer (Archer)
&bull; Ethan Hunt (Mission Impossible)
&bull; Emma Peel (The Avengers - 1960s TV show)
&bull; Austin Powers (Austin Powers movies)

This seems very strong!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
ARCHER, HUNT, PEEL, POWERS

Let me analyze these for patterns:

1. Card game or poker terms:
&bull; RAISE (poker action)
&bull; JACK (playing card)
&bull; FISH (Go Fish, or a poker fish/weak player)
&bull; Could CRANK relate to cards? Not that I know.

2. Compound words with a common element:

3. "___JACK" combinations:
&bull; LUMBER + JACK = LUMBERJACK (LUMBER not here)

4. Types of exercises or activities:

&bull; WALK
&bull; Could RAISE be part of this? (like raise your arms?)
&bull; JACK (jumping jacks!)
&bull; CRANK (crank out exercises?)

Wait! Exercises:
&bull; JUMPING JACKS (JACK)
&bull; HIKE (hiking)
&bull; WALK (walking)
&bull; CRANK (like crank/push-ups? Or cranking motion?)
&bull; RAISE (like leg raises, calf raises)

5. Let me think about "JUMPING ___":
&bull; JUMPING JACKS
&bull; JUMPING ROPE (not here)
&bull; JUMPING BEANS (not here)

6. Or "____ JACKS":
&bull; JUMPING JACKS
&bull; FLAPJACKS (not here)
&bull; Could others work?

7. What about things that can be "FISH":
&bull; FISH + TAIL = FISHTAIL
&bull; Could be a verb (to fishtail)

8. Verbs or actions:
&bull; FISH (to fish)
&bull; HIKE (to hike)  
&bull; WALK (to walk)
&bull; RAISE (to raise)
&bull; CRANK (to crank)
&bull; NAP (to nap)
&bull; TAIL (to tail someone)
&bull; JACK (to jack up)

9. Things you can do on a trail or outdoors:
&bull; HIKE
&bull; WALK
&bull; FISH
&bull; NAP (?)

10. Let me think about phone-related terms:
&bull; CRANK (crank call)
&bull; Could others relate?
&bull; JACK (phone jack)

11. Phone/call related:
&bull; CRANK (crank call)
&bull; Could FISH be phishing? (different spelling)
&bull; WAKE (wake-up call, not here)

12. Types of calls:
&bull; CRANK call
&bull; WAKE call (not here)
&bull; CURTAIN call (not here)
&bull; ROLL call (not here)

13. Let me think about "___ call":
&bull; CRANK call
&bull; WAKE call
&bull; PHONE call
&bull; Could FISH, NAP, HIKE, WALK, JACK, RAISE, or TAIL go before CALL?

14. "___TAIL":
&bull; FISH + TAIL = FISHTAIL
&bull; PONY + TAIL = PONYTAIL (PONY not here)
&bull; COCK + TAIL = COCKTAIL (COCK not here)
&bull; Could HIKE, WALK, NAP work? No.

15. Phone jack, car jack, jack up - different uses of JACK

16. Let me reconsider - things that can come before "KNIFE":
&bull; JACK + KNIFE = JACKKNIFE
&bull; FISH + KNIFE = Not really
&bull; Could be a diving term: JACKKNIFE dive

17. Wait, types of dives or swimming moves:
&bull; JACKKNIFE (dive)
&bull; Could FISH relate? (swimming like a fish?)
&bull; CRANK? HIKE? WALK? Probably not.

18. Let me think about automotive terms:
&bull; JACK (car jack)
&bull; CRANK (crankshaft)
&bull; Could TAIL relate? (tailpipe, tailgate)
&bull; HIKE (not automotive)

19. Or things that go before a common word - let me try systematically:

"___ UP":
&bull; JACK UP
&bull; CRANK UP  
&bull; HIKE UP
&bull; Could work!
&bull; RAISE UP (redundant but could work)
&bull; WALK UP
&bull; Could NAP UP work? No.
&bull; TAIL UP? Not really.
&bull; FISH UP? Not common.

Let me try:
JACK, CRANK, HIKE, RAISE - all can be followed by "UP"
&bull; JACK UP (lift something)
&bull; CRANK UP (turn up volume/intensity)
&bull; HIKE UP (pull up pants, or hike up a price)
&bull; RAISE UP (lift up)

This seems promising!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Available words: BID, MACRO, NAME, TELEPHOTO, NUMBER, DRIVER, FINLET, ZOOM, EBAY, EMAIL, ADDRESS, PETITION, FISHEYE, APPEAL, FLAKE, CALL

Let me look for potential categories:

1. <b>Camera/Photography lens types</b>: MACRO, TELEPHOTO, FISHEYE, ZOOM - These are all types of camera lenses or lens settings.

2. <b>Contact/Communication information</b>: NAME, NUMBER, EMAIL, ADDRESS - These are all pieces of contact information you might give someone.

3. <b>Legal/Request terms</b>: BID, PETITION, APPEAL, CALL - These could be legal or formal request terms, though this seems less certain.

4. <b>Auction/eBay related</b>: BID, EBAY - Only 2 words, need more.

5. <b>Words that can follow a common word</b>: Let me think about what could precede or follow these words...
   - DRIVER could be part of compound words
   - FINLET and FLAKE are interesting - could these be fish-related?

6. <b>Fish parts or fish-related</b>: FINLET (small fin), FLAKE (fish meat term) - but I need 4.

Let me reconsider:
&bull; ZOOM could be the video platform, or a lens type
&bull; CALL could be a phone call, or a legal appeal

Actually, looking more carefully:
&bull; <b>Types of camera lenses</b>: MACRO, TELEPHOTO, FISHEYE, ZOOM - This seems very strong. All are photography lens types.

This seems like the most confident group. Let me start with this.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

BID, NAME, NUMBER, DRIVER, FINLET, EBAY, EMAIL, ADDRESS, PETITION, APPEAL, FLAKE, CALL

Let me identify the next category:

1. <b>Contact information</b>: NAME, NUMBER, EMAIL, ADDRESS - These are all pieces of contact/personal information. This seems very strong.

2. <b>Legal/Formal request terms</b>: BID, PETITION, APPEAL, CALL - These could all be types of formal requests or legal actions:
   - BID: an offer/proposal
   - PETITION: a formal written request
   - APPEAL: a request for reconsideration
   - CALL: could be a call for action/request

3. <b>eBay related</b>: BID, EBAY - only 2 words

4. <b>Other words</b>: DRIVER, FINLET, FLAKE

Let me think about other patterns:
&bull; Could DRIVER, FINLET, FLAKE, and one other word form a group?
&bull; FINLET is a small fin on a fish
&bull; FLAKE can mean fish meat or a small piece
&bull; DRIVER... could this be fish-related? Like a golf driver? Or driver (person)?

Wait, let me think about words that can come after something:
&bull; CAB + DRIVER
&bull; SNOW + FLAKE
&bull; But I need a consistent pattern

I think the contact information group (NAME, NUMBER, EMAIL, ADDRESS) is the strongest and most clear-cut category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

BID, DRIVER, FINLET, EBAY, PETITION, APPEAL, FLAKE, CALL

Let me analyze these remaining words:

1. <b>Legal/Formal request terms</b>: BID, PETITION, APPEAL, CALL
   - BID: an offer or proposal
   - PETITION: a formal written request
   - APPEAL: a request for reconsideration/review
   - CALL: a demand or request (like "a call for action")
   These could all be types of formal requests or entreaties.

2. <b>Remaining words</b>: DRIVER, FINLET, EBAY, FLAKE

Let me think about the remaining 4 if the legal group is correct:
&bull; DRIVER, FINLET, EBAY, FLAKE
&bull; What could connect these?
&bull; EBAY is an auction site
&bull; Could these be compound words with a common prefix or suffix?
&bull; PILE + DRIVER
&bull; SNOW + FLAKE
&bull; Hmm, these don't seem to share a pattern with FINLET and EBAY

Let me reconsider. Maybe:
&bull; Words that can follow "SNOW": FLAKE works, but not the others
&bull; Words that can follow "PILE": DRIVER works, but not the others
&bull; Words related to eBay: BID, EBAY... but that's only 2

Actually, thinking about it differently:
&bull; APPEAL, PETITION, CALL could all be types of requests
&bull; Could BID be more related to EBAY in a different grouping?

1. Compound words with a common word?
   - PILE + DRIVER = PILEDRIVER
   - SNOW + FLAKE = SNOWFLAKE
   - Could FINLET work? FIN + LET (suffix meaning small)
   - EBAY?

2. Let me think about what word could precede all of these:
   - ___ DRIVER
   - ___ FINLET
   - ___ EBAY
   - ___ FLAKE

3. Or what word could follow:
   - DRIVER ___
   - FINLET ___
   - EBAY ___
   - FLAKE ___

4. Words ending in similar patterns?
   - FINLET ends in -LET
   - Could these all have suffixes? No, doesn't work.

5. Let me think: PILE
   - PILE + DRIVER = PILEDRIVER (wrestling move/construction equipment)
   - PILE + ??? 

Actually, wait - could these all follow "SNOW"?
&bull; SNOW + FLAKE = SNOWFLAKE ✓
&bull; SNOW + DRIVER? Not really
&bull; SNOW + FINLET? No
&bull; SNOW + EBAY? No

Or "PILE"?
&bull; PILE + DRIVER = PILEDRIVER ✓
&bull; PILE + ??? Hmm

Since these are the last 4 words, they MUST form a group. Let me just guess them.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Looking at the words:

Potential categories I can see:

1. <b>Streets in London</b>: DOWNING (Downing Street), FLEET (Fleet Street), WALL (Wall Street - wait, that's NYC), MAIN (Main Street)... Let me reconsider. DOWNING Street, FLEET Street are famous London streets. What about GATE? Could be part of street names.

2. <b>Things that can be "STREET"</b>: DOWNING Street, FLEET Street, MAIN Street, WALL Street - these are all famous streets!

3. <b>Map/Navigation elements</b>: SCALE, COMPASS, KEY, INSET - these are all elements you'd find on a map!

4. <b>Entries/Openings</b>: DOOR, GATE, PORTAL, HATCH - all ways to enter/exit

5. <b>Words that can precede or follow other words</b>: TOP, BEST, BETTER, BEAT

Let me focus on the strongest connections:

<b>Map elements</b> (very strong): SCALE, COMPASS, KEY, INSET - all standard components of a map legend/features
&bull; SCALE: shows distance ratio
&bull; COMPASS: shows direction (compass rose)
&bull; KEY: legend explaining symbols
&bull; INSET: smaller detailed map within the main map

<b>Famous Streets</b> (strong): DOWNING, FLEET, MAIN, WALL
&bull; DOWNING Street (UK Prime Minister's residence)
&bull; FLEET Street (historic newspaper district in London)
&bull; MAIN Street (common street name, also symbolic)
&bull; WALL Street (NYC financial district)

<b>Openings/Passages</b>: DOOR, GATE, PORTAL, HATCH - all entrances/exits

<b>Remaining</b>: TOP, BEST, BETTER, BEAT - could these relate to each other? They could all relate to superiority or winning.

   - They could all be superlatives or comparative forms
   - Or maybe they can all follow or precede a common word?
   - Wait... could they all be anagrams or word play related?
   - TOP, BEST, BETTER, BEAT... 
   - Let me think about "____ SELLER": BEST seller, TOP seller...
   - Or could they relate to spinning toys? TOP is a spinning toy...
   - Actually, thinking about it: BEST, BETTER, BEAT could all relate to superiority/winning

Let me go with the ENTRANCES/OPENINGS category as it's very clear:
DOOR, GATE, PORTAL, HATCH - all types of openings or entryways.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

TOP, BEST, BETTER, BEAT

These must form the last group. Let me figure out their connection:

&bull; TOP: highest point, spinning toy, upper part, verb meaning to surpass
&bull; BEST: optimal, finest, verb meaning to defeat
&bull; BETTER: superior, comparative form of good
&bull; BEAT: to defeat, to strike rhythmically, past tense of beat

What could connect these four?

Possibilities:
1. They can all mean "to defeat" or "to surpass"
   - BEST: to best someone
   - BEAT: to beat someone
   - BETTER: to better someone (less common but possible)
   - TOP: to top someone

2. They could all be related to competitive advantage or winning

3. Maybe they can all precede or follow a specific word?

4. Could they be verbs meaning "to surpass/defeat"?
   - "I will BEAT you"
   - "I will BEST you" 
   - "I will TOP that"
   - "I will BETTER you" (maybe less common)

Since these are the only 4 remaining, they must be the answer regardless of what I think the connection is!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Available words: WOOD, SPARK, LAMINATE, BANSHEE, FIREWORKS, WAILER, STRAND, CONNECTION, COAST, BANK, CARPET, SHORE, PIP, HEARTBREAKER, TILE, CHEMISTRY

Let me look for potential categories:

1. <b>Flooring materials</b>: WOOD, LAMINATE, CARPET, TILE - These are all types of flooring. This seems like a strong category.

2. <b>Water/Beach related</b>: COAST, BANK, SHORE, STRAND - All relate to the edge of water bodies. STRAND can mean a beach or shore.

3. <b>Things that can follow "TOM"</b>: WAILER (Tom Wailer), PETTY (Tom Petty - wait, PETTY isn't here), HEARTBREAKER (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers), BANSHEE... Let me reconsider.

4. <b>Led Zeppelin songs</b>: "Heartbreaker", "Communication Breakdown" (CONNECTION?), "The Ocean" (COAST/SHORE?)... This might be a stretch.

5. <b>Words that can follow a common word</b>: 
   - BANK: River bank, blood bank
   - CHEMISTRY: Could this be part of something?
   - CONNECTION: Could relate to relationships or bonds
   - SPARK: Could relate to romance/chemistry

&bull; SPARK (romantic spark)
&bull; CHEMISTRY (romantic chemistry)
&bull; CONNECTION (romantic connection)
&bull; HEARTBREAKER (someone who breaks hearts)

This could be "romantic relationship terms" or "dating/attraction terms"

Let me reconsider the flooring category first as it seems most concrete:
WOOD, LAMINATE, CARPET, TILE - all are flooring types.

   - COAST: ocean coast
   - BANK: river bank
   - SHORE: lake shore, ocean shore
   - STRAND: can mean beach or shore (like "stranded on a beach")
   This seems very strong.

2. <b>Romance/Attraction terms</b>: SPARK, CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, HEARTBREAKER

5. <b>Tom Petty songs/band</b>: HEARTBREAKER (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers), but I'd need to figure out the others...

6. <b>FIREWORKS, BANSHEE</b>: These don't fit the above patterns yet.

&bull; PIP: Gladys Knight and the Pips
&bull; HEARTBREAKER: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers

Let me consider potential categories:

1. Body parts: EAR, HEAD, NOSE - only 3, need one more. WING could work (bird's wing), but that seems weak.

2. Things that can follow "WAX":

The wax category is also good:

   - JET LAG - yes, definitely
   - JET DROP - not really
   - JET FREEZE - no
   - JET ECHO - no

2. <b>Words that can follow "TIME"</b>:
   - TIME LAG - yes
   - TIME FREEZE - sort of (like freeze frame)
   - TIME DROP - not really
   - TIME ECHO - not really

3. <b>Words that can precede "TAG"</b>:
   - FREEZE TAG - yes! (children's game)
   - LAG TAG - no
   - DROP TAG - no
   - ECHO TAG - no

4. <b>Commands/Actions</b>:
   - DROP (drop it!)
   - FREEZE (freeze!)
   - ECHO (echo this)
   - LAG (not really a command)

5. <b>Computer/Network terms</b>:
   - LAG (network lag)
   - DROP (packet drop, connection drop)
   - FREEZE (computer freeze)
   - ECHO (echo command in programming)

The computer/network/tech terminology seems most likely! All four can be used in a computing context:
&bull; LAG - network lag, input lag
&bull; DROP - packet drop, frame drop, connection drop
&bull; FREEZE - system freeze, screen freeze
&bull; ECHO - echo command, echo in networking

This must be it since these are the only 4 remaining!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
DROP, LAG, FREEZE, ECHO

First, let me identify what I see:
&bull; IMPACT, ROUNDOFF, AERIAL, ARABESQUE, SPLIT - these could be gymnastics moves
&bull; VOLUMETRIC, LINEAR, ANGULAR, AREAL - these sound like measurement/dimension terms
&bull; VERDANA, GEORGIA, ARIAL - these are definitely fonts/typefaces
&bull; ARIEL, AURORA, MERIDA, TIANA - these are Disney Princesses (Ariel from Little Mermaid, Aurora from Sleeping Beauty, Merida from Brave, Tiana from Princess and the Frog)

Let me verify my categories:

1. <b>Disney Princesses</b>: ARIEL, AURORA, MERIDA, TIANA - This seems very solid. All four are Disney Princess characters.

2. <b>Fonts</b>: VERDANA, GEORGIA, ARIAL - Wait, I only have 3. Let me check if there's another font... Could IMPACT be a font? Yes! IMPACT is a bold font. So: IMPACT, VERDANA, GEORGIA, ARIAL

3. <b>Gymnastics moves</b>: ROUNDOFF, AERIAL, ARABESQUE, SPLIT - These are all gymnastics/dance moves

4. <b>Types of measurements/dimensions</b>: VOLUMETRIC (volume), LINEAR (length), ANGULAR (angle), AREAL (area) - These all relate to types of measurements

Let me double-check:
&bull; Fonts: IMPACT (yes, a font), VERDANA (yes), GEORGIA (yes), ARIAL (yes) - all computer fonts
&bull; Disney Princesses: ARIEL, AURORA, MERIDA, TIANA - confirmed
&bull; Gymnastics: ROUNDOFF, AERIAL, ARABESQUE, SPLIT - all moves
&bull; Measurements: VOLUMETRIC, LINEAR, ANGULAR, AREAL - all types of measurements

The fonts category seems strongest and most clearly defined. I'll start with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me reconsider my remaining categories:

1. <b>Disney Princesses</b>: ARIEL, AURORA, MERIDA, TIANA - These are definitely Disney Princesses:
   - Ariel from "The Little Mermaid"
   - Aurora from "Sleeping Beauty"
   - Merida from "Brave"
   - Tiana from "The Princess and the Frog"

2. <b>Gymnastics/Dance moves</b>: ROUNDOFF, AERIAL, ARABESQUE, SPLIT
   - ROUNDOFF - a gymnastics move
   - AERIAL - a cartwheel with no hands
   - ARABESQUE - a ballet/dance position
   - SPLIT - a flexibility position

3. <b>Types of measurements/dimensions</b>: VOLUMETRIC, LINEAR, ANGULAR, AREAL
   - VOLUMETRIC - relating to volume (3D)
   - LINEAR - relating to length (1D)
   - ANGULAR - relating to angles
   - AREAL - relating to area (2D)

All three categories seem strong. Disney Princesses is very clear-cut and definitive. I'll go with that next.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me analyze my remaining two categories:

1. <b>Gymnastics/Dance moves</b>: ROUNDOFF, AERIAL, ARABESQUE, SPLIT
   - ROUNDOFF - a gymnastics move (like a cartwheel into a snap down)
   - AERIAL - a cartwheel with no hands touching the ground
   - ARABESQUE - a ballet position with one leg extended behind
   - SPLIT - a position where legs are extended in opposite directions

2. <b>Types of measurements/dimensions</b>: VOLUMETRIC, LINEAR, ANGULAR, AREAL
   - VOLUMETRIC - relating to volume/3D measurement
   - LINEAR - relating to one-dimensional measurement (length)
   - ANGULAR - relating to angles/rotation
   - AREAL - relating to two-dimensional measurement (area)

Both categories seem solid. The measurements category is very technical and specific - all are adjectives describing types of measurements or dimensional properties. This seems like a strong NYT Connections category.

I'll go with the measurements category as it's very precise and technical.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Looking at the words:
FANTASY, ALTERNATE, BACKUP, VAPORIZE, COVER, HACK, SUB, SHRINK, CONDENSE, SUIT, MELT, FREEZE, HERO, COPPER, HONEY, SOMEDAY

Potential categories I can identify:

1. <b>States of matter/Phase changes</b>: VAPORIZE, CONDENSE, MELT, FREEZE - These are all processes related to changes in states of matter (solid, liquid, gas).

2. <b>Substitutes/Replacements</b>: ALTERNATE, BACKUP, COVER, SUB - These all relate to being a replacement or substitute for something/someone.

3. <b>Terms of endearment/Sweet names</b>: HONEY, SUGAR (not present)... Wait, let me reconsider.

4. <b>Words that can follow "SANDWICH"</b>: HERO (hero sandwich), SUB (sub sandwich)... but that only gives me 2.

5. <b>Sci-fi or genre types</b>: FANTASY could be a genre...

Let me reconsider more carefully:

&bull; COPPER, HONEY - could these be terms of endearment or colors?
&bull; SOMEDAY could relate to time
&bull; HACK, SUIT - professional terms?

Wait, let me think about compound words or phrases:
&bull; "HONEY" could be a term of endearment
&bull; "COPPER" could be slang for police officer
&bull; These could be informal terms for people

Let me try another angle - sandwich types:
&bull; HERO (hero sandwich)
&bull; SUB (submarine sandwich)
&bull; Hmm, only 2 there.

Actually, reconsidering the substitution group more carefully:
&bull; ALTERNATE - substitute
&bull; BACKUP - replacement/substitute
&bull; COVER - to fill in for someone
&bull; SUB - substitute

This seems like a very strong category. Let me go with this first.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me analyze these:

1. <b>Terms of endearment or informal names</b>: 
   - HONEY - term of endearment
   - COPPER - but this is slang for police officer
   - Hmm, not quite fitting

2. <b>Words that can follow "SUPER"</b>:
   - SUPERHERO
   - SUPERSUIT (from The Incredibles - "No capes!")
   - Hmm, what else?

3. <b>Slang terms for people/professions</b>:
   - SUIT - businessperson/corporate person
   - SHRINK - psychiatrist/therapist
   - COPPER - police officer
   - HERO - but this doesn't fit the slang pattern as well
   
   Wait, this could work! SUIT, SHRINK, COPPER are all slang terms for types of people/professions.
   What could the fourth be? HONEY? Not really slang for a profession.

4. <b>Music/Song related</b>:
   - "HONEY" - could be from song titles
   - "SOMEDAY" - could be from song titles
   - "FANTASY" - could be from song titles
   - "HERO" - could be from song titles (Mariah Carey, etc.)

   Actually, these could all be one-word song titles or parts of famous song titles.

Let me think more carefully about the slang for people:
&bull; SUIT - corporate/business person
&bull; SHRINK - psychiatrist
&bull; COPPER - police officer
&bull; What about HERO? Not really slang...

Maybe words that can follow "FANTASY":
&bull; FANTASY SUIT? No.
&bull; FANTASY HERO? Maybe in gaming context?

Let me try the slang professions angle with different combinations. Could HONEY be slang? Or SOMEDAY?

Actually, thinking about it differently - words associated with Mariah Carey songs:
&bull; HERO (song by Mariah Carey)
&bull; HONEY (song by Mariah Carey)
&bull; FANTASY (song by Mariah Carey)
&bull; SOMEDAY (song by Mariah Carey)

This could be it! All Mariah Carey song titles!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

&bull; SHRINK - slang for psychiatrist/therapist
&bull; SUIT - slang for businessperson/lawyer
&bull; COPPER - slang for police officer
&bull; HACK - slang for taxi driver or a bad writer/journalist

Yes! These are all slang terms for different professions/types of people:

Let me look for potential categories:

1. <b>Types of bears</b>: BROWN, POLAR, BLACK, SUN
   - Brown bear, Polar bear, Black bear, Sun bear - this seems like a strong connection!

2. <b>Words meaning "not bright/weak"</b>: PALE, FAINT, DIM, LIGHT
   - These all can mean lacking intensity or brightness

3. <b>Cooking/mixing actions</b>: WHIP, WHISK, BEAT, CREAM
   - WHIP (whip cream), WHISK (mixing tool/action), BEAT (beat eggs), CREAM (cream butter)
   - These are all cooking techniques related to mixing

4. <b>Hair colors</b>: BLONDE, BROWN, BLACK
   - Missing one... but BROWN and BLACK are already in the bear category

5. <b>Compound word possibilities</b>:
   - POOL could go with: WORD (word pool?), LIGHT (light pool?)
   - RICE could go with: CREAM (rice cream?), BROWN (brown rice!)

Let me reconsider:
&bull; Could RICE go with cooking terms? Rice can be beaten, but that's less clear.
&bull; POOL and WORD... swimming pool, word pool, car pool

Actually, let me think about <b>types of bears</b> more carefully:

   - PALE - lacking color, washed out
   - FAINT - weak, barely visible
   - DIM - not bright, low light

2. <b>Remaining words</b>: RICE, POOL, WORD, BLONDE

Remaining words: POUND, WING, WON, BILL, SOLDIER, DOLLAR, PRIVATE, NICKEL, STERLING, PERSONAL, SECRET, INNER

Now let me look for the next group:

1. <b>Currency names:</b>
   - POUND (British currency)
   - WON (Korean currency)
   - DOLLAR (US currency)
   - STERLING (pound sterling - British currency)
   
   This looks very strong! All four are currency names.

2. <b>Privacy/secrecy related:</b>
   - PRIVATE
   - PERSONAL
   - SECRET
   - INNER (inner thoughts?)
   
   This could work too.

3. <b>Money-related but different:</b>
   - BILL (dollar bill, or a bill to pay)
   - NICKEL (5-cent coin)
   - DOLLAR
   - POUND
   
4. <b>Could any relate to buildings/architecture?</b>
   - WING (wing of a building)
   - Not seeing others clearly

5. <b>Military:</b>
   - PRIVATE (rank)
   - SOLDIER (general term)
   - Not enough here

Let me think about STERLING - it could be:
&bull; Part of "pound sterling" (currency)
&bull; An adjective meaning "excellent"
&bull; A name

I think the currency group is strongest: POUND, WON, DOLLAR, STERLING

All four are names of currencies used in different countries.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: WING, BILL, SOLDIER, PRIVATE, NICKEL, PERSONAL, SECRET, INNER

Now let me find the next group:

1. <b>Privacy/secrecy related:</b>
   - PRIVATE
   - PERSONAL
   - SECRET
   - INNER (inner thoughts, inner circle)
   
   All four could relate to things that are private, not public, or kept to oneself.

2. <b>Nicknames or informal terms:</b>
   - BILL (nickname for William)
   - NICK (not here, but NICKEL?)
   
3. <b>Parts of things:</b>
   - WING (wing of a building, wing of a plane)
   - Not seeing clear others

4. <b>Could these go with a common word?</b>
   - SOLDIER, PRIVATE - military
   - BILL - dollar bill, or William

Let me think about what connects the remaining words differently:

&bull; WING, BILL, SOLDIER, PRIVATE, NICKEL, PERSONAL, SECRET, INNER

Could there be a word that precedes or follows all of them?

Actually, thinking about "_______ SOLDIER":
&bull; TOY SOLDIER
&bull; FOOT SOLDIER
&bull; PRIVATE is a rank, not a type of soldier

What about things that can be "PRIVATE":
&bull; PRIVATE PARTS
&bull; PRIVATE PROPERTY
&bull; PRIVATE SOLDIER (yes, this is a thing!)

Hmm, let me focus on the privacy group:
PRIVATE, PERSONAL, SECRET, INNER - all describe things that are not public or shared.

This seems very strong.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: WING, BILL, SOLDIER, NICKEL

Only 4 words left, so this must be the final group! Let me figure out what connects them:

1. <b>Could they all be types of something?</b>
   - WING - body part, building part, political faction
   - BILL - beak of a bird, paper money, invoice
   - SOLDIER - military person
   - NICKEL - coin, metal

2. <b>Could they all go with a common word?</b>
   - TIN SOLDIER
   - TIN BILL? (no)
   - TIN NICKEL? (no)
   - TIN WING? (no)

3. <b>Buffalo connections?</b>
   - BUFFALO SOLDIER (Bob Marley song, historical term)
   - BUFFALO BILL (Wild West figure)
   - BUFFALO NICKEL (yes! A type of US coin)
   - BUFFALO WING (yes! A type of chicken wing)

That's it! They all go with BUFFALO!
&bull; BUFFALO SOLDIER
&bull; BUFFALO BILL
&bull; BUFFALO NICKEL
&bull; BUFFALO WING

This must be the connection!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Available words: FREE, TANG, SINGLE, BILLY, SOLO, SONG, PUNCH, MING, BUCK, ZING, JACK, STAG, HAN, ZEST, RAM, KICK

Let me look for potential categories:

1. <b>Words meaning "alone" or "single"</b>: 
   - SOLO (alone)
   - SINGLE (alone, one)
   - STAG (as in stag party - going alone)
   - BUCK (less certain, but could relate)

2. <b>Words meaning "energy/liveliness"</b>:
   - ZING (energy, liveliness)
   - ZEST (enthusiasm, energy)
   - KICK (excitement, thrill)
   - PUNCH (impact, power)
   - TANG (could fit - sharpness/bite)

3. <b>Chinese dynasties</b>:
   - TANG (Tang Dynasty)
   - MING (Ming Dynasty)
   - HAN (Han Dynasty)
   - SONG (Song Dynasty)
   This looks very strong!

4. <b>Male animals or "male" related</b>:
   - BILLY (billy goat)
   - BUCK (male deer)
   - JACK (male donkey)
   - RAM (male sheep)
   - STAG (male deer)
   This has 5 words, so one might belong elsewhere.

5. <b>"Going solo" or "alone" words</b>:
   - SOLO
   - SINGLE
   - STAG (stag = going alone)
   - FREE (free agent, unattached)

Let me reconsider:
&bull; Chinese Dynasties: TANG, MING, HAN, SONG - this is the strongest connection
&bull; Male animals: BILLY, BUCK, JACK, RAM, STAG (5 words - need to eliminate one)
&bull; Energy/spice words: ZING, ZEST, KICK, PUNCH, TANG (but TANG is likely dynasty)
&bull; Solo/alone: SOLO, SINGLE, STAG, FREE

The Chinese dynasties group seems most certain. Let me start with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: FREE, SINGLE, BILLY, SOLO, PUNCH, BUCK, ZING, JACK, STAG, ZEST, RAM, KICK

Now let me reconsider the remaining 12 words:

1. <b>Male animals</b>:
   - BILLY (billy goat - male goat)
   - BUCK (male deer, male rabbit)
   - JACK (male donkey, jackass)
   - RAM (male sheep)
   - STAG (male deer)
   This has 5 words, so I need to figure out which 4 go together.

2. <b>Words meaning energy/excitement/flavor</b>:
   - ZING (energy, excitement)
   - ZEST (enthusiasm, flavor)
   - KICK (excitement, punch)
   - PUNCH (impact, force)

3. <b>Words meaning "alone/single"</b>:
   - SOLO (alone)
   - SINGLE (alone, one)
   - STAG (going stag = going alone)
   - FREE (unattached, free agent)

Wait, let me reconsider STAG. It could mean:
&bull; Male deer (animal)
&bull; Going stag (alone to an event)

The male animals group: BILLY, BUCK, JACK, RAM, STAG
That's 5 words. But if STAG goes with the "alone" group, then:
&bull; Male animals: BILLY, BUCK, JACK, RAM (4 words - perfect!)
&bull; Alone/single: SOLO, SINGLE, STAG, FREE (4 words - perfect!)
&bull; Energy words: ZING, ZEST, KICK, PUNCH (4 words - perfect!)

Let me go with the male animals group since that seems very solid.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

This should be the final group of 4. Let me verify they all share a common connection:

&bull; FREE (free agent - unattached, going without a partner)
&bull; SINGLE (alone, not in a relationship, one person)
&bull; SOLO (alone, by oneself)
&bull; STAG (going stag - attending an event without a date/partner)

Looking at the words:
PRANK, STAIRWAY, FLOAT, BABA, PUNK, HOTEL, TRICK, FLAPPER, CHAIN, THONG, BRIEF, BOXER, HIPSTER, FOOL, BOHEMIAN, HANDLE

Potential categories I can identify:

1. <b>Types of underwear/undergarments</b>: THONG, BRIEF, BOXER, HIPSTER
   - These are all styles of underwear. This seems like a strong connection.

2. <b>Words that can follow "RHAPSODY"</b>: BOHEMIAN (Bohemian Rhapsody), BLUE could work but isn't here...
   - Actually, looking at famous songs: "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen, "Hotel California", "Stairway to Heaven"...

3. <b>Classic rock songs</b> (partial titles): STAIRWAY (to Heaven), HOTEL (California), BOHEMIAN (Rhapsody), BABA (O'Riley)
   - This could be a strong category!

4. <b>Words meaning to deceive/joke</b>: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, PUNK
   - These all relate to deceiving or playing tricks on someone

5. <b>1920s era related</b>: FLAPPER (1920s dancer/woman), BOHEMIAN (lifestyle)...

6. <b>Things with links</b>: CHAIN (has links)...

Let me reconsider:
&bull; THONG, BRIEF, BOXER, HIPSTER - all types of underwear (very confident)
&bull; PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, PUNK - all verbs meaning to deceive/joke with someone
&bull; STAIRWAY, HOTEL, BOHEMIAN, BABA - parts of classic rock song titles (Stairway to Heaven, Hotel California, Bohemian Rhapsody, Baba O'Riley)
&bull; FLAPPER, FLOAT, CHAIN, HANDLE - less certain about these

   - CHAIN - the pull chain in older toilets
   - HANDLE - the flush handle on a toilet

   - FLOAT - the ball that rises and falls with water level

Now I have 12 words remaining:
SHOEHORN, RAINBOW, PINWHEEL, STREET, FLAG, NEIGHBORHOOD, WEDGE, VANE, KANGAROO, JAM, STUFF, WIND CHIME

Let me reconsider the categories:

1. <b>Force something into a space (verbs)</b>: SHOEHORN, WEDGE, JAM, STUFF
   - SHOEHORN = force into a tight space
   - WEDGE = force into a narrow space  
   - JAM = pack tightly
   - STUFF = pack full
   This is very strong - all about forcing/cramming things into spaces.

2. <b>Things that move/spin in wind</b>: PINWHEEL, VANE, FLAG, WIND CHIME
   - PINWHEEL = spins in wind
   - VANE (weather vane) = turns in wind
   - FLAG = flaps in wind
   - WIND CHIME = moves/sounds in wind
   This could be things activated by or responsive to wind.

3. <b>Remaining</b>: RAINBOW, STREET, NEIGHBORHOOD, KANGAROO
   - These would need to form the final group
   - Could they all have something in common?
   - RAINBOW could be "Rainbow Connection" or "Reading Rainbow"
   - STREET could be "Sesame Street"
   - NEIGHBORHOOD could be "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"
   - KANGAROO could be "Captain Kangaroo"
   These are all classic children's TV shows!

So my groups seem to be:
1. ✓ Reversing position (already got this)
2. Force into space: SHOEHORN, WEDGE, JAM, STUFF
3. Wind-activated items: PINWHEEL, VANE, FLAG, WIND CHIME
4. Children's TV shows: RAINBOW, STREET, NEIGHBORHOOD, KANGAROO

I'll go with the "force into space" category next as it seems very solid.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Available words: OREO, ENCORE, LUXOR, EASE, ORCA, VOLUME, ARIA, AYES, ARS, PERIMETER, OWES, DOMINO, EXCALIBUR, AREA, CROSSWORD, LENGTH

Let me look for patterns:

1. <b>Las Vegas Hotels/Casinos</b>: LUXOR, EXCALIBUR, ARIA - these are all famous Las Vegas casino hotels. Need one more... Could DOMINO be one? Let me think of other Vegas casinos... Actually, I don't think DOMINO is a major Vegas casino.

2. <b>Anagrams or word play</b>: Let me check if any words are anagrams:
   - EASE = AYES? No, different letters
   - OWES, ARIA, ORCA, OREO - let me check these
   - AREA and ARIA are close
   - ARS could be anagram related

3. <b>Mathematical/Geometric terms</b>: AREA, PERIMETER, VOLUME, LENGTH - these are all mathematical measurements! This seems very strong.

4. <b>Words containing "OR"</b>: OREO, LUXOR, ORCA, ENCORE, CROSSWORD... many have OR

5. <b>Palindromes or reversals</b>: 
   - ARIA reversed is AIRA
   - Let me check: ENCORE reversed is EROCNE
   
6. <b>Words that become new words when reversed</b>:
   - ARS reversed = SRA
   - AREA reversed = AERA
   - Wait... let me think about this differently

7. <b>Words ending in same sound</b>: AREA, ARIA sound similar

Let me reconsider anagrams:
&bull; EASE = AEES... 
&bull; OWES = SOWE...
&bull; Could AREA, EASE, AYES, ARS be anagrams? Let me check letter counts:
  - AREA (4 letters: A, R, E, A)
  - EASE (4 letters: E, A, S, E)
  - AYES (4 letters: A, Y, E, S)
  - ARS (3 letters) - no, different length

The strongest group I see is: <b>AREA, PERIMETER, VOLUME, LENGTH</b> - all mathematical measurements/dimensions.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: GENESIS, ALF, FLY, DAWN, MTV, POLE, BIRTH, START, FLOWER, DAY, NES, VHS

Now let me reconsider the categories:

1. <b>Beginnings/Origins</b>: GENESIS, DAWN, BIRTH, START - all relate to the beginning of something
   - GENESIS = beginning, origin
   - DAWN = beginning of day
   - BIRTH = beginning of life
   - START = beginning

2. <b>1980s nostalgia/retro media</b>: MTV, NES, VHS, ALF
   - MTV (Music Television, 1981)
   - NES (Nintendo Entertainment System, 1985)
   - VHS (Video format)
   - ALF (TV show, 1986-1990)

3. Remaining words: FLY, POLE, FLOWER, DAY

Let me think about what FLY, POLE, FLOWER, DAY could have in common...
Could these all go before a common word?
&bull; FLY + ? = flyby, fly ball, fly fishing
&bull; POLE + ? = pole vault, pole position
&bull; FLOWER + ? = flower bed, flower pot
&bull; DAY + ? = daylight, daybreak, day trip

Or after a common word?
&bull; BUTTER + FLY = butterfly
&bull; NORTH/SOUTH + POLE = North Pole/South Pole
&bull; SUN/WILD + FLOWER = sunflower/wildflower
&bull; BIRTH + DAY = birthday

Wait! Could these all go after BIRTH?
&bull; BIRTH + DAY = birthday
&bull; Hmm, that doesn't work for all.

Let me go with the strongest remaining category: beginnings/origins.

Devil features:
