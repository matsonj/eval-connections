Looking at the words:
WING, EAR, FLEECE, ROB, HOSE, HEAD, CABIN, ENGINE, STIFF, CRAYON, HONEYCOMB, SEAL, CANDLE, STALK, NOSE, BULB

Let me consider potential categories:

1. Body parts: EAR, HEAD, NOSE - only 3, need one more. WING could work (bird's wing), but that seems weak.

2. Things that can follow "WAX": 
   - WAX SEAL
   - WAX CANDLE
   - WAX CRAYON
   - WAX EAR (earwax)
   This could be a strong connection!

3. Aircraft parts: WING, CABIN, ENGINE, NOSE - these are all parts of an airplane! This seems very strong.

4. Verbs meaning to steal/cheat: FLEECE (to swindle), ROB (to steal), STIFF (to cheat someone out of payment), HOSE (slang for cheat/swindle)

5. Things made from wax: SEAL, CANDLE, CRAYON, HONEYCOMB (beeswax honeycomb)

Let me reconsider:
- Airplane parts: WING, CABIN, ENGINE, NOSE - this is very solid
- Words that can follow WAX or are made of wax: SEAL, CANDLE, CRAYON, and possibly EAR (earwax)
- Verbs meaning to cheat/steal: FLEECE, ROB, STIFF, HOSE

The airplane parts seem like the strongest connection. Let me go with that first.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me identify what I see:
- IMPACT, ROUNDOFF, AERIAL, ARABESQUE, SPLIT - these could be gymnastics moves
- VOLUMETRIC, LINEAR, ANGULAR, AREAL - these sound like measurement/dimension terms
- VERDANA, GEORGIA, ARIAL - these are definitely fonts/typefaces
- ARIEL, AURORA, MERIDA, TIANA - these are Disney Princesses (Ariel from Little Mermaid, Aurora from Sleeping Beauty, Merida from Brave, Tiana from Princess and the Frog)

Let me verify my categories:

1. **Disney Princesses**: ARIEL, AURORA, MERIDA, TIANA - This seems very solid. All four are Disney Princess characters.

2. **Fonts**: VERDANA, GEORGIA, ARIAL - Wait, I only have 3. Let me check if there's another font... Could IMPACT be a font? Yes! IMPACT is a bold font. So: IMPACT, VERDANA, GEORGIA, ARIAL

3. **Gymnastics moves**: ROUNDOFF, AERIAL, ARABESQUE, SPLIT - These are all gymnastics/dance moves

4. **Types of measurements/dimensions**: VOLUMETRIC (volume), LINEAR (length), ANGULAR (angle), AREAL (area) - These all relate to types of measurements

Let me double-check:
- Fonts: IMPACT (yes, a font), VERDANA (yes), GEORGIA (yes), ARIAL (yes) - all computer fonts
- Disney Princesses: ARIEL, AURORA, MERIDA, TIANA - confirmed
- Gymnastics: ROUNDOFF, AERIAL, ARABESQUE, SPLIT - all moves
- Measurements: VOLUMETRIC, LINEAR, ANGULAR, AREAL - all types of measurements

The fonts category seems strongest and most clearly defined. I'll start with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Available words: BROWN, WHIP, SUN, WHISK, RICE, LIGHT, CREAM, POLAR, BEAT, BLACK, PALE, FAINT, POOL, WORD, DIM, BLONDE

Let me look for potential categories:

1. **Types of bears**: BROWN, POLAR, BLACK, SUN
   - Brown bear, Polar bear, Black bear, Sun bear - this seems like a strong connection!

2. **Words meaning "not bright/weak"**: PALE, FAINT, DIM, LIGHT
   - These all can mean lacking intensity or brightness

3. **Cooking/mixing actions**: WHIP, WHISK, BEAT, CREAM
   - WHIP (whip cream), WHISK (mixing tool/action), BEAT (beat eggs), CREAM (cream butter)
   - These are all cooking techniques related to mixing

4. **Hair colors**: BLONDE, BROWN, BLACK
   - Missing one... but BROWN and BLACK are already in the bear category

5. **Compound word possibilities**:
   - POOL could go with: WORD (word pool?), LIGHT (light pool?)
   - RICE could go with: CREAM (rice cream?), BROWN (brown rice!)

Let me reconsider:
- Could RICE go with cooking terms? Rice can be beaten, but that's less clear.
- POOL and WORD... swimming pool, word pool, car pool

Actually, let me think about **types of bears** more carefully:
- BROWN bear ✓
- POLAR bear ✓
- BLACK bear ✓
- SUN bear ✓

This seems very solid. I'll go with this as my first guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me look for potential categories:

1. **Camera/Photography lens types**: MACRO, TELEPHOTO, FISHEYE, ZOOM - These are all types of camera lenses or lens settings.

2. **Contact/Communication information**: NAME, NUMBER, EMAIL, ADDRESS - These are all pieces of contact information you might give someone.

3. **Legal/Request terms**: BID, PETITION, APPEAL, CALL - These could be legal or formal request terms, though this seems less certain.

4. **Auction/eBay related**: BID, EBAY - Only 2 words, need more.

5. **Words that can follow a common word**: Let me think about what could precede or follow these words...
   - DRIVER could be part of compound words
   - FINLET and FLAKE are interesting - could these be fish-related?

6. **Fish parts or fish-related**: FINLET (small fin), FLAKE (fish meat term) - but I need 4.

Let me reconsider:
- ZOOM could be the video platform, or a lens type
- CALL could be a phone call, or a legal appeal

Actually, looking more carefully:
- **Types of camera lenses**: MACRO, TELEPHOTO, FISHEYE, ZOOM - This seems very strong. All are photography lens types.

Available words: FREE, TANG, SINGLE, BILLY, SOLO, SONG, PUNCH, MING, BUCK, ZING, JACK, STAG, HAN, ZEST, RAM, KICK

Let me look for potential categories:

1. **Words meaning "alone" or "single"**: 
   - SOLO (alone)
   - SINGLE (alone, one)
   - STAG (as in stag party - going alone)
   - BUCK (less certain, but could relate)

2. **Words meaning "energy/liveliness"**:
   - ZING (energy, liveliness)
   - ZEST (enthusiasm, energy)
   - KICK (excitement, thrill)
   - PUNCH (impact, power)
   - TANG (could fit - sharpness/bite)

3. **Chinese dynasties**:
   - TANG (Tang Dynasty)
   - MING (Ming Dynasty)
   - HAN (Han Dynasty)
   - SONG (Song Dynasty)
   This looks very strong!

4. **Male animals or "male" related**:
   - BILLY (billy goat)
   - BUCK (male deer)
   - JACK (male donkey)
   - RAM (male sheep)
   - STAG (male deer)
   This has 5 words, so one might belong elsewhere.

5. **"Going solo" or "alone" words**:
   - SOLO
   - SINGLE
   - STAG (stag = going alone)
   - FREE (free agent, unattached)

Let me reconsider:
- Chinese Dynasties: TANG, MING, HAN, SONG - this is the strongest connection
- Male animals: BILLY, BUCK, JACK, RAM, STAG (5 words - need to eliminate one)
- Energy/spice words: ZING, ZEST, KICK, PUNCH, TANG (but TANG is likely dynasty)
- Solo/alone: SOLO, SINGLE, STAG, FREE

The Chinese dynasties group seems most certain. Let me start with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Looking at the words:
SCALE, HATCH, TOP, PORTAL, BEST, GATE, COMPASS, BETTER, INSET, WALL, BEAT, DOWNING, MAIN, FLEET, DOOR, KEY

Potential categories I can see:

1. **Streets in London**: DOWNING (Downing Street), FLEET (Fleet Street), WALL (Wall Street - wait, that's NYC), MAIN (Main Street)... Let me reconsider. DOWNING Street, FLEET Street are famous London streets. What about GATE? Could be part of street names.

2. **Things that can be "STREET"**: DOWNING Street, FLEET Street, MAIN Street, WALL Street - these are all famous streets!

3. **Map/Navigation elements**: SCALE, COMPASS, KEY, INSET - these are all elements you'd find on a map!

4. **Entries/Openings**: DOOR, GATE, PORTAL, HATCH - all ways to enter/exit

5. **Words that can precede or follow other words**: TOP, BEST, BETTER, BEAT

Let me focus on the strongest connections:

**Map elements** (very strong): SCALE, COMPASS, KEY, INSET - all standard components of a map legend/features
- SCALE: shows distance ratio
- COMPASS: shows direction (compass rose)
- KEY: legend explaining symbols
- INSET: smaller detailed map within the main map

**Famous Streets** (strong): DOWNING, FLEET, MAIN, WALL
- DOWNING Street (UK Prime Minister's residence)
- FLEET Street (historic newspaper district in London)
- MAIN Street (common street name, also symbolic)
- WALL Street (NYC financial district)

**Openings/Passages**: DOOR, GATE, PORTAL, HATCH - all entrances/exits

**Remaining**: TOP, BEST, BETTER, BEAT - could these relate to each other? They could all relate to superiority or winning.

I'm most confident about the MAP ELEMENTS group.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

1. Verbs meaning to cheat/steal/swindle:
   - FLEECE (to swindle)
   - ROB (to steal)
   - STIFF (to cheat someone out of payment)
   - HOSE (slang for cheat/swindle)
   This seems very strong!

2. Things that can be made of wax or associated with wax:
   - SEAL (wax seal)
   - CANDLE (wax candle)
   - CRAYON (wax crayon)
   - HONEYCOMB (beeswax honeycomb)
   - EAR (earwax)

3. Things with "BULB":
   - BULB itself
   - Could there be compound words? HEAD could be "bulbhead"? Not strong.

4. Parts of plants:
   - STALK (plant stalk)
   - BULB (plant bulb)
   - HEAD (cabbage head, flower head)
   Need one more...

5. Let me think about "____ of lettuce" or vegetable parts:
   - HEAD (head of lettuce, head of cabbage)
   - STALK (stalk of celery)
   - BULB (bulb of garlic)
   - EAR (ear of corn)
   This is very interesting!

The verbs meaning to cheat/steal seems very solid: FLEECE, ROB, STIFF, HOSE

   - GENESIS = beginning, origin
   - DAWN = beginning of day
   - BIRTH = beginning of life

2. **1980s nostalgia/retro media**: MTV, NES, VHS, ALF
   - MTV (Music Television, 1981)
   - NES (Nintendo Entertainment System, 1985)
   - VHS (Video format)
   - ALF (TV show, 1986-1990)

3. Remaining words: FLY, POLE, FLOWER, DAY

Let me think about what FLY, POLE, FLOWER, DAY could have in common...
Could these all go before a common word?
- FLY + ? = flyby, fly ball, fly fishing
- POLE + ? = pole vault, pole position
- FLOWER + ? = flower bed, flower pot
- DAY + ? = daylight, daybreak, day trip

Or after a common word?
- BUTTER + FLY = butterfly
- NORTH/SOUTH + POLE = North Pole/South Pole
- SUN/WILD + FLOWER = sunflower/wildflower
- BIRTH + DAY = birthday

Wait! Could these all go after BIRTH?
- BIRTH + DAY = birthday

1. **Male animals**:
   - BILLY (billy goat - male goat)
   - BUCK (male deer, male rabbit)
   - JACK (male donkey, jackass)
   - RAM (male sheep)
   - STAG (male deer)
   This has 5 words, so I need to figure out which 4 go together.

2. **Words meaning energy/excitement/flavor**:
   - ZING (energy, excitement)
   - ZEST (enthusiasm, flavor)
   - KICK (excitement, punch)
   - PUNCH (impact, force)

3. **Words meaning "alone/single"**:
   - SOLO (alone)
   - SINGLE (alone, one)
   - STAG (going stag = going alone)
   - FREE (unattached, free agent)

Wait, let me reconsider STAG. It could mean:
- Male deer (animal)
- Going stag (alone to an event)

The male animals group: BILLY, BUCK, JACK, RAM, STAG
That's 5 words. But if STAG goes with the "alone" group, then:
- Male animals: BILLY, BUCK, JACK, RAM (4 words - perfect!)
- Alone/single: SOLO, SINGLE, STAG, FREE (4 words - perfect!)
- Energy words: ZING, ZEST, KICK, PUNCH (4 words - perfect!)

2. **Legal/Formal request terms**: BID, PETITION, APPEAL, CALL - These could all be types of formal requests or legal actions:
   - BID: an offer/proposal
   - PETITION: a formal written request
   - APPEAL: a request for reconsideration
   - CALL: could be a call for action/request

3. **eBay related**: BID, EBAY - only 2 words

4. **Other words**: DRIVER, FINLET, FLAKE

Let me think about other patterns:
- Could DRIVER, FINLET, FLAKE, and one other word form a group?
- FINLET is a small fin on a fish
- FLAKE can mean fish meat or a small piece
- DRIVER... could this be fish-related? Like a golf driver? Or driver (person)?

   - SPLIT - a position where legs are extended in opposite directions

2. **Types of measurements/dimensions**: VOLUMETRIC, LINEAR, ANGULAR, AREAL

   - LINEAR - relating to one-dimensional measurement (length)
   - ANGULAR - relating to angles/rotation
   - AREAL - relating to two-dimensional measurement (area)

   - LIGHT - can mean pale in color (light blue, light colors)
   - These all relate to lack of intensity or brightness

2. **Remaining words**: RICE, POOL, WORD, BLONDE

If the DIM/PALE/FAINT/LIGHT group is correct, then RICE, POOL, WORD, BLONDE must form a category.

Let me think about RICE, POOL, WORD, BLONDE:
- CAR ___: CAR POOL ✓
- ___ PAPER: RICE paper ✓
- ___ WORD: ? 
- ___ BLONDE: ?

Or ___ CAKE:
- RICE cake ✓
- WORD... no
- POOL... no
- BLONDE... no

Or types of something with BLONDE, RICE, POOL, WORD...

Actually, thinking about compound words:
- GENE POOL ✓
- RICE PAPER ✓
- WORD PLAY... or WORD SEARCH... or CROSS WORD ✓
- BLONDE... BLONDE ALE? BLONDE HAIR?

Hmm, or maybe they all go before a specific word?
- RICE ___
- POOL ___
- WORD ___
- BLONDE ___

I'm more confident in the PALE, FAINT, DIM, LIGHT group as words meaning "not bright/weak".</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

3. **Classic rock songs** (partial titles): STAIRWAY (to Heaven), HOTEL (California), BOHEMIAN (Rhapsody), BABA (O'Riley)
   - This could be a strong category!

4. **Words meaning to deceive/joke**: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, PUNK

5. **1920s era related**: FLAPPER (1920s dancer/woman), BOHEMIAN (lifestyle)...

- PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, PUNK - all verbs meaning to deceive/joke with someone
- STAIRWAY, HOTEL, BOHEMIAN, BABA - parts of classic rock song titles (Stairway to Heaven, Hotel California, Bohemian Rhapsody, Baba O'Riley)

Potential categories I can identify:

1. **Types of luggage/bags**: DUFFEL, CARRY-ON, HARD-SHELL... and maybe RUBBER? No, that doesn't work well.

2. **___ wheel** words: FERRIS (wheel), ROLLER (?), BUMPER (?), MERRY (go round - not wheel)

3. **Adjectives describing disposition/personality**: SUNNY, BRIGHT, BOUNCY, MERRY - these all can describe a cheerful personality

4. **Types of balls or things that bounce**: BOUNCY, RUBBER, BUMPER... hmm

5. **Words that can precede "ball"**: BOUNCY (ball), RUBBER (ball), BUMPER (ball?)... 

6. **Famous people named ___**: PEE-WEE (Herman), HEATHER (common name), INDIANA (Jones), FERRIS (Bueller)

Wait, let me reconsider the "famous ___" pattern:
- PEE-WEE Herman (comedian/character)
- FERRIS Bueller (movie character)
- INDIANA Jones (movie character)
- HEATHER... Heather Locklear? Or could it be another pattern?

- FERRIS Bueller's Day Off
- INDIANA Jones
- PEE-WEE Herman
- HEATHER - from the movie "Heathers"?

Let me think about luggage types:
- DUFFEL (bag)
- CARRY-ON (bag)
- HARD-SHELL (suitcase)

And for cheerful disposition:
- SUNNY (disposition)
- BRIGHT (personality)
- BOUNCY (personality)

1. **Flooring materials**: WOOD, LAMINATE, CARPET, TILE - These are all types of flooring. This seems like a strong category.

2. **Water/Beach related**: COAST, BANK, SHORE, STRAND - All relate to the edge of water bodies. STRAND can mean a beach or shore.

3. **Things that can follow "TOM"**: WAILER (Tom Wailer), PETTY (Tom Petty - wait, PETTY isn't here), HEARTBREAKER (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers), BANSHEE... Let me reconsider.

Available words: OREO, ENCORE, LUXOR, EASE, ORCA, VOLUME, ARIA, AYES, ARS, PERIMETER, OWES, DOMINO, EXCALIBUR, AREA, CROSSWORD, LENGTH

Let me look for patterns:

1. **Las Vegas Hotels/Casinos**: LUXOR, EXCALIBUR, ARIA - these are all famous Las Vegas casino hotels. Need one more... Could DOMINO be one? Let me think of other Vegas casinos... Actually, I don't think DOMINO is a major Vegas casino.

2. **Anagrams or word play**: Let me check if any words are anagrams:
   - EASE = AYES? No, different letters
   - OWES, ARIA, ORCA, OREO - let me check these
   - AREA and ARIA are close
   - ARS could be anagram related

3. **Mathematical/Geometric terms**: AREA, PERIMETER, VOLUME, LENGTH - these are all mathematical measurements! This seems very strong.

4. **Words containing "OR"**: OREO, LUXOR, ORCA, ENCORE, CROSSWORD... many have OR

5. **Palindromes or reversals**: 
   - ARIA reversed is AIRA
   - Let me check: ENCORE reversed is EROCNE
   
6. **Words that become new words when reversed**:
   - ARS reversed = SRA
   - AREA reversed = AERA
   - Wait... let me think about this differently

7. **Words ending in same sound**: AREA, ARIA sound similar

Let me reconsider anagrams:
- EASE = AEES... 
- OWES = SOWE...
- Could AREA, EASE, AYES, ARS be anagrams? Let me check letter counts:
  - AREA (4 letters: A, R, E, A)
  - EASE (4 letters: E, A, S, E)
  - AYES (4 letters: A, Y, E, S)
  - ARS (3 letters) - no, different length

The strongest group I see is: **AREA, PERIMETER, VOLUME, LENGTH** - all mathematical measurements/dimensions.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, let me identify potential categories:

**Camera brands:**
- HASSELBLAD (Swedish camera manufacturer)
- FUJIFILM (Japanese camera/film company)
- OLYMPUS (Japanese camera company)
- POLAROID (Instant camera brand)

This looks like a strong group of 4 camera manufacturers.

**Things associated with Italian cities:**
- BOLOGNESE (Bologna - sauce)
- VENETIAN (Venice - style/blinds)
- PARMESAN (Parma - cheese)
- NEAPOLITAN (Naples - ice cream)

These are all adjectives derived from Italian city names.

**Things at a stadium/sports venue:**
- SCOREBOARD (displays score)
- JUMBOTRON (large screen)
- KISSCAM (camera feature at games)
- SKYBOX (luxury seating)
- ASTROTURF (artificial grass)

This has 5 items, so I need to narrow it down.

**Other words:**
- CREAMSICLE (ice cream treat)
- JOURNEYMAN (experienced worker)
- RUSHMORE (Mount Rushmore)

Let me reconsider. ASTROTURF could be artificial/fake things, but that doesn't help much.

Actually, looking more carefully:
- ASTROTURF, SCOREBOARD, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, SKYBOX are all stadium-related

But that's 5 words. Let me think which one doesn't belong or if there's another pattern.

Wait - could some of these be related to "fake" or "artificial"? ASTROTURF is fake grass, CREAMSICLE could be artificial orange...

Let me reconsider NEAPOLITAN - it's also an ice cream flavor like CREAMSICLE.

Actually, I'm most confident about the camera brands group:
HASSELBLAD, FUJIFILM, OLYMPUS, POLAROID

Let me start with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me reconsider the categories:

1. **Water's edge/shoreline terms**: COAST, BANK, SHORE, STRAND
   - COAST: ocean coast
   - BANK: river bank
   - SHORE: lake shore, ocean shore
   - STRAND: can mean beach or shore (like "stranded on a beach")
   This seems very strong.

2. **Romance/Attraction terms**: SPARK, CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, HEARTBREAKER
   - SPARK: romantic spark
   - CHEMISTRY: romantic chemistry
   - CONNECTION: romantic connection
   - HEARTBREAKER: someone who breaks hearts
   This also seems strong.

3. **Bob Marley related**: WAILER (Bob Marley and the Wailers), but I'd need 3 more...

4. **Things with PIP**: PIP could be in "Gladys Knight and the Pips", or could relate to seeds, or could be part of something else.

5. **Tom Petty songs/band**: HEARTBREAKER (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers), but I'd need to figure out the others...

6. **FIREWORKS, BANSHEE**: These don't fit the above patterns yet.

Let me go with the water's edge category as it seems very solid:
COAST, BANK, SHORE, STRAND - all mean the edge of a body of water.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me reconsider the patterns:

1. Religious titles/figures: POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, BISHOP, SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK - still 5, need to find the right 4

2. Looking at potential compound words or phrases:
   - BIRD - Lady Bird Johnson (First Lady)
   - BURNS - Robert Burns (poet)
   - LORDE - Lorde (singer)
   
Wait, could these be people who go by one name or have "FIRST ___" in their title?

Actually, let me think about Catholic/Christian titles that could precede a name:
- POPE (Pope Francis)
- SAINT (Saint Valentine, Saint Patrick)
- MOTHER (Mother Teresa)
- BISHOP (Bishop Desmond Tutu)

These are all religious titles that come before a person's name!

The remaining would be:
- BIRD, LORDE, BURNS, N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER, CLERGY MEMBER, SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK, PRESIDENT

Hmm, but SAINT VALENTINE and SAINT PATRICK already have SAINT in them...

Let me reconsider: titles that go before names:
- PRESIDENT (President Lincoln)
- POPE (Pope John Paul)
- MOTHER (Mother Teresa)
- BISHOP (Bishop Tutu)

Actually, CLERGY MEMBER doesn't typically go before a name like the others do.

Let me try: POPE, MOTHER, BISHOP, PRESIDENT - these are all titles that precede a person's name.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

   - TRICK (to deceive)
   - FOOL (to deceive)

2. **Remaining words**: FLOAT, FLAPPER, CHAIN, HANDLE

2. **Devil/Satan imagery**: HORNS, TAIL, PITCHFORK, GOATEE

Both seem very solid. Let me think about which one to go with:

Track &amp; field:
- POLE - pole vault
- HAMMER - hammer throw
- HURDLE - hurdle race
- BATON - relay race (baton passing)

Devil features:
- HORNS - devil has horns
- TAIL - devil has a pointed tail
- PITCHFORK - devil carries a pitchfork/trident
- GOATEE - devil is often depicted with a goatee beard

Both are equally strong. I'll go with the track and field category since it's a very concrete, specific category (all are pieces of equipment or obstacles used in specific track and field events).</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
POLE, HAMMER, HURDLE, BATON

Now I have 12 words remaining:
SHOEHORN, RAINBOW, PINWHEEL, STREET, FLAG, NEIGHBORHOOD, WEDGE, VANE, KANGAROO, JAM, STUFF, WIND CHIME

Let me reconsider the categories:

1. **Force something into a space (verbs)**: SHOEHORN, WEDGE, JAM, STUFF
   - SHOEHORN = force into a tight space
   - WEDGE = force into a narrow space  
   - JAM = pack tightly
   - STUFF = pack full
   This is very strong - all about forcing/cramming things into spaces.

2. **Things that move/spin in wind**: PINWHEEL, VANE, FLAG, WIND CHIME
   - PINWHEEL = spins in wind
   - VANE (weather vane) = turns in wind
   - FLAG = flaps in wind
   - WIND CHIME = moves/sounds in wind
   This could be things activated by or responsive to wind.

3. **Remaining**: RAINBOW, STREET, NEIGHBORHOOD, KANGAROO
   - These would need to form the final group
   - Could they all have something in common?
   - RAINBOW could be "Rainbow Connection" or "Reading Rainbow"
   - STREET could be "Sesame Street"
   - NEIGHBORHOOD could be "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"
   - KANGAROO could be "Captain Kangaroo"
   These are all classic children's TV shows!

So my groups seem to be:
1. ✓ Reversing position (already got this)
2. Force into space: SHOEHORN, WEDGE, JAM, STUFF
3. Wind-activated items: PINWHEEL, VANE, FLAG, WIND CHIME
4. Children's TV shows: RAINBOW, STREET, NEIGHBORHOOD, KANGAROO

I'll go with the "force into space" category next as it seems very solid.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Wait, I notice BRIGHT was in my last guess. Let me recount the remaining words:
BUMPER, FERRIS, PEE-WEE, BABY, BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, INDIANA

That's 8 words, which means 2 groups of 4 remain.

Let me think about possible categories:

1. **Famous characters (first names)**:
- PEE-WEE (Herman - comedian/character)
- FERRIS (Bueller - from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off")
- INDIANA (Jones - from Indiana Jones movies)
- BABY (from "Dirty Dancing" - "Nobody puts Baby in a corner")
or
- HEATHER (from "Heathers")

2. **Types/styles related to something**:
- BUMPER (bumper cars, bumper sticker)
- BUGGY (baby buggy, dune buggy)
- RUBBER (rubber duck, rubber band)
- HEATHER (heather gray - a color)

Wait, could these be types of things?
- BUMPER crop/sticker/cars
- RUBBER duck/band/stamp
- BABY buggy/powder/blues
- BUGGY whip/ride

Or words that can precede a common word?

Let me think about "_____ gray":
- HEATHER gray (color)
- Could others be colors or shades?

Actually, thinking about movie characters again:
- FERRIS Bueller
- INDIANA Jones  
- PEE-WEE Herman
- BABY (from Dirty Dancing)

This seems very strong as they're all iconic movie characters known by their first names!

The remaining would be:
BUMPER, BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER

What could connect these? 
- HEATHER (a type of plant/color)
- RUBBER (material)
- BUMPER (car part)
- BUGGY (vehicle)

Hmm, or could they all precede "BALL"?
- RUBBER ball
- BUMPER ball? (those inflatable things you wear)
- No, not quite working.

I'm most confident in the movie characters group.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

ASTROTURF, SCOREBOARD, CREAMSICLE, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, SKYBOX

Let me think about possible categories:

**Stadium/Sports venue items:**
- SCOREBOARD (displays score)
- JUMBOTRON (large screen)
- KISSCAM (camera feature at games)
- SKYBOX (luxury seating)
- ASTROTURF (artificial grass)

That's still 5 items, so one must belong to a different category.

**Remaining words:**
- CREAMSICLE (ice cream treat)
- JOURNEYMAN (experienced worker/tradesperson)
- RUSHMORE (Mount Rushmore monument)

Let me think about alternative connections:

Could these be compound words with a pattern? 
- ASTROTURF = ASTRO + TURF
- CREAMSICLE = CREAM + SICLE (icicle)
- SCOREBOARD = SCORE + BOARD
- JUMBOTRON = JUMBO + TRON
- KISSCAM = KISS + CAM
- SKYBOX = SKY + BOX

Hmm, could there be a pattern where the second part or first part relates to something?

Wait - could some of these be related to colors or visual patterns?
- CREAMSICLE (orange and white)
- ASTROTURF (fake/artificial green)

Or maybe famous films/works:
- RUSHMORE (Wes Anderson film)
- JOURNEYMAN (could be a film)

Let me think about "BILL MURRAY movies" or Wes Anderson films... but that seems too specific.

Actually, let me reconsider: Could ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE, JOURNEYMAN, and RUSHMORE share something? They all could be described with another word pattern...

I think the safest bet is still the stadium group, but I need to pick 4 of the 5. Let me go with the most obvious stadium fixtures:

Looking at the words:
FANTASY, ALTERNATE, BACKUP, VAPORIZE, COVER, HACK, SUB, SHRINK, CONDENSE, SUIT, MELT, FREEZE, HERO, COPPER, HONEY, SOMEDAY

Potential categories I can identify:

1. **States of matter/Phase changes**: VAPORIZE, CONDENSE, MELT, FREEZE - These are all processes related to changes in states of matter (solid, liquid, gas).

2. **Substitutes/Replacements**: ALTERNATE, BACKUP, COVER, SUB - These all relate to being a replacement or substitute for something/someone.

3. **Terms of endearment/Sweet names**: HONEY, SUGAR (not present)... Wait, let me reconsider.

4. **Words that can follow "SANDWICH"**: HERO (hero sandwich), SUB (sub sandwich)... but that only gives me 2.

5. **Sci-fi or genre types**: FANTASY could be a genre...

Let me reconsider more carefully:

- COPPER, HONEY - could these be terms of endearment or colors?
- SOMEDAY could relate to time
- HACK, SUIT - professional terms?

Wait, let me think about compound words or phrases:
- "HONEY" could be a term of endearment
- "COPPER" could be slang for police officer
- These could be informal terms for people

Let me try another angle - sandwich types:
- HERO (hero sandwich)
- SUB (submarine sandwich)
- Hmm, only 2 there.

Actually, reconsidering the substitution group more carefully:
- ALTERNATE - substitute
- BACKUP - replacement/substitute
- COVER - to fill in for someone
- SUB - substitute

This seems like a very strong category. Let me go with this first.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

3. Actions/Verbs:
- HUNT
- HIKE
- WALK
- NAP
- PEEL
- RAISE
- CRANK

4. Things that can follow "AUSTIN":
- POWERS (Austin Powers)
- Could there be others?

5. Things with "JACK":
- JACK (by itself)
- Could be part of compound words

6. Let me think about compound words or phrases:
- FISH could be part of many compounds
- TAIL could be part of many compounds
- PEEL could be part of many compounds

7. Austin ___ (Famous Austins):
- POWERS (Austin Powers)
- Could ARCHER be Sterling Archer? No, that's Sterling.

8. Wait, let me reconsider - things that can come before "JACK":
- CRANK (crankjack? no, crankshaft)
- LUMBER (lumberjack)

9. Or things that come after "JACK":
- FISH (no)
- POT (jackpot)

10. Let me think about "___ RAISE":
- RAISE could combine with others

11. Compound words with JACK:
- JACK + POT = JACKPOT
- JACK + KNIFE = JACKKNIFE
- LUMBER + JACK = LUMBERJACK
- FLAPJACK, BLACKJACK

12. What about things that go with TAIL:
- FISH + TAIL = FISHTAIL
- Could others work?

13. Let me reconsider types of exercises or movements:
- HIKE
- WALK
- CRANK (crank up?)
- RAISE (raise up?)

14. Card game related - types of raises or bets:
- RAISE
- CALL (not here)
- CHECK (not here)

Let me start with my strongest hypothesis - words meaning nonsense/lies:
BALONEY, BUNK, RUBBISH, BULL

These all are slang terms for nonsense or lies.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
BALONEY, BUNK, RUBBISH, BULL

Remaining words: POUND, WING, WON, BILL, SOLDIER, DOLLAR, PRIVATE, NICKEL, STERLING, PERSONAL, SECRET, INNER

Now let me look for the next group:

1. **Currency names:**
   - POUND (British currency)
   - WON (Korean currency)
   - DOLLAR (US currency)
   - STERLING (pound sterling - British currency)
   
   This looks very strong! All four are currency names.

2. **Privacy/secrecy related:**
   - PRIVATE
   - PERSONAL
   - SECRET
   - INNER (inner thoughts?)
   
   This could work too.

3. **Money-related but different:**
   - BILL (dollar bill, or a bill to pay)
   - NICKEL (5-cent coin)
   - DOLLAR
   - POUND
   
4. **Could any relate to buildings/architecture?**
   - WING (wing of a building)
   - Not seeing others clearly

5. **Military:**
   - PRIVATE (rank)
   - SOLDIER (general term)
   - Not enough here

Let me think about STERLING - it could be:
- Part of "pound sterling" (currency)
- An adjective meaning "excellent"
- A name

I think the currency group is strongest: POUND, WON, DOLLAR, STERLING

All four are names of currencies used in different countries.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me reconsider the 8 remaining words:
ASTROTURF, SCOREBOARD, CREAMSICLE, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, SKYBOX

If the stadium group isn't SCOREBOARD, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, SKYBOX, then maybe one of those belongs elsewhere and ASTROTURF is part of the stadium group instead?

Let me think about other patterns:

Could there be a "____MAN" pattern or compound word pattern?
- JOURNEYMAN

What about films or pop culture references?
- RUSHMORE (Wes Anderson film, 1998)

Wait, let me think about Bill Murray movies or Wes Anderson films:
- RUSHMORE (Bill Murray film)
- Could any others be Bill Murray films?

Or maybe there's a "fake/artificial" theme:
- ASTROTURF (fake grass)
- CREAMSICLE (artificial flavoring?)

Let me think about orange things or striped things:
- CREAMSICLE (orange and white)
- ASTROTURF (could be any color but typically green)

Hmm, what if there's a pattern with words that can follow or precede a certain word?

What about things that are "fake" or "mock" or "artificial"?
- ASTROTURF (artificial turf)

Or compound words where both parts are independent words?
- ASTROTURF (not really - "astro" isn't a standalone common word for this context)
- SCOREBOARD (SCORE + BOARD)
- CREAMSICLE (CREAM + icicle sound)
- JUMBOTRON (JUMBO + tron)
- KISSCAM (KISS + CAM)
- JOURNEYMAN (JOURNEY + MAN)
- SKYBOX (SKY + BOX)

Let me try a different approach: Maybe ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE, JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE form a group?

- MOUNT RUSHMORE (yes!)

Or could they share another prefix pattern?

Remaining 8 words:
BUMPER, FERRIS, PEE-WEE, BABY, BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, INDIANA

Let me reconsider. If those four aren't all movie characters, maybe the grouping is different.

Let me think about what else these could be:

**Words that can precede "BALL":**
- RUBBER ball
- BUMPER ball (those zorb-like inflatable balls)
- Could others work? BABY ball? BUGGY ball? Doesn't seem right.

**Words that can follow a common word:**

Could these be "_____ DUCK"?
- RUBBER duck
- Could others be ducks? Not really.

What about different patterns:

**League/team names or sports:**
- PEE-WEE (Pee-Wee league - youth sports)
- RUBBER (rubber match - final game in a series)
- Could BUMPER be related? Bumper pool?
- BABY (baby pool?)

**Types of crops or harvest-related:**
- BUMPER crop (large harvest)
- RUBBER (rubber tree/plantation)
- HEATHER (a plant)
- BABY (baby vegetables?)

Actually, BUMPER crop is a strong phrase. Let me think about what else could be "_____ crop":
- BUMPER crop
- Could others work?

Or maybe these are all adjectives/words that describe size or type:
- PEE-WEE (small)
- BABY (small)
- BUMPER (large, as in bumper crop)
- RUBBER (material type)

Wait! Words that mean SMALL or describing youth levels:
- PEE-WEE (youth sports level)
- BABY (infant level)
- Could BUGGY relate? Baby buggy?

Let me think about sports/league divisions:
- PEE-WEE league
- Could RUBBER match fit?

Or what about types of "_____ MATCH":
- RUBBER match (deciding game)
- BUMPER ... no

Let me try: BUMPER, HEATHER, RUBBER, BABY - types of materials or textures? No...

Actually, could they all be types of something in sports/games:
- RUBBER match
- BUMPER pool
- PEE-WEE league
- BABY pool?

Let me think more carefully. I've been wrong about two groups now.

Looking at the structure:
- N.F.L. PLAYER
- M.L.B. PLAYER
- CLERGY MEMBER
- BISHOP (which is a type of clergy)

Could there be a pattern where BISHOP goes with N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER, and CLERGY MEMBER?

Wait, what if these are all things that can come after a specific word?

Let me think about "CHESS ___":
- BISHOP is a chess piece
- Hmm, no other chess pieces visible

What about things that could follow "LARRY"?
- LARRY BIRD (famous basketball player)
- LARRY POPE (CEO?)
- LARRY BURNS (character from The Simpsons)
- LARRY LORDE? (doesn't seem right)

Or maybe these can all follow "CARDINAL"?
- CARDINAL BISHOP (rank in Catholic Church)
- Hmm, Cardinals play in NFL and MLB...

Wait! CARDINAL!
- CARDINAL (bird)
- CARDINAL (M.L.B. player - St. Louis Cardinals)
- CARDINAL (N.F.L. player - Arizona Cardinals)  
- CARDINAL (clergy member/religious rank)

So: BIRD, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, CLERGY MEMBER could all be preceded by "CARDINAL"!

A cardinal is a type of bird, a Cardinals player in MLB, a Cardinals player in NFL, and a Cardinal is a high-ranking clergy member!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now let me find the next group:

1. **Privacy/secrecy related:**
   - PRIVATE
   - PERSONAL
   - SECRET
   - INNER (inner thoughts, inner circle)
   
   All four could relate to things that are private, not public, or kept to oneself.

2. **Nicknames or informal terms:**
   - BILL (nickname for William)
   - NICK (not here, but NICKEL?)
   
3. **Parts of things:**
   - WING (wing of a building, wing of a plane)
   - Not seeing clear others

4. **Could these go with a common word?**
   - SOLDIER, PRIVATE - military
   - BILL - dollar bill, or William

Let me think about what connects the remaining words differently:

- WING, BILL, SOLDIER, PRIVATE, NICKEL, PERSONAL, SECRET, INNER

Could there be a word that precedes or follows all of them?

Actually, thinking about "_______ SOLDIER":
- TOY SOLDIER
- FOOT SOLDIER
- PRIVATE is a rank, not a type of soldier

What about things that can be "PRIVATE":
- PRIVATE PARTS
- PRIVATE PROPERTY
- PRIVATE SOLDIER (yes, this is a thing!)

Hmm, let me focus on the privacy group:
PRIVATE, PERSONAL, SECRET, INNER - all describe things that are not public or shared.

   - All common costume ideas

2. **Words that can follow "JET"**:

   - PRINCESS - Jasmine
   - MONKEY - Abu (Aladdin's pet monkey)
   - PARROT - Iago (the parrot in Aladdin)

- GENIE (the genie)
- PRINCESS (Princess Jasmine)
- MONKEY (Abu)
- PARROT (Iago)

Now I have 8 words remaining:
FANTASY, SHRINK, SUIT, HERO, COPPER, HONEY, SOMEDAY

Let me analyze these:

1. **Terms of endearment or informal names**: 
   - HONEY - term of endearment
   - COPPER - but this is slang for police officer
   - Hmm, not quite fitting

2. **Words that can follow "SUPER"**:
   - SUPERHERO
   - SUPERSUIT (from The Incredibles - "No capes!")
   - Hmm, what else?

3. **Slang terms for people/professions**:
   - SUIT - businessperson/corporate person
   - SHRINK - psychiatrist/therapist
   - COPPER - police officer
   - HERO - but this doesn't fit the slang pattern as well
   
   Wait, this could work! SUIT, SHRINK, COPPER are all slang terms for types of people/professions.
   What could the fourth be? HONEY? Not really slang for a profession.

4. **Music/Song related**:
   - "HONEY" - could be from song titles
   - "SOMEDAY" - could be from song titles
   - "FANTASY" - could be from song titles
   - "HERO" - could be from song titles (Mariah Carey, etc.)

   Actually, these could all be one-word song titles or parts of famous song titles.

Let me think more carefully about the slang for people:
- SUIT - corporate/business person
- SHRINK - psychiatrist
- COPPER - police officer
- What about HERO? Not really slang...

Maybe words that can follow "FANTASY":
- FANTASY SUIT? No.
- FANTASY HERO? Maybe in gaming context?

Let me try the slang professions angle with different combinations. Could HONEY be slang? Or SOMEDAY?

Actually, thinking about it differently - words associated with Mariah Carey songs:
- HERO (song by Mariah Carey)
- HONEY (song by Mariah Carey)
- FANTASY (song by Mariah Carey)
- SOMEDAY (song by Mariah Carey)

This could be it! All Mariah Carey song titles!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

FISH, NAP, HUNT, HIKE, POWERS, PEEL, RAISE, JACK, WALK, CRANK, ARCHER, TAIL

Let me look for the next category:

1. Types of walks/movements:
- HIKE (a type of walk)
- WALK
- NAP (not a walk)
- HUNT (not a walk)

2. Things that can precede or follow a common word:
- Let me think about JACK combinations:
  - LUMBERJACK (LUMBER + JACK)
  - FLAPJACK (FLAP + JACK)
  - Could CRANK work? CRANKJACK? No...
  - JACK + FISH = JACKFISH (a type of fish)
  - JACK + KNIFE = JACKKNIFE
  - JACK + POT = JACKPOT
  - JACK + RABBIT = JACKRABBIT

3. Let me think about compound words with these:
- POWER + WALK = POWERWALK
- POWER + NAP = POWERNAP
- POWER + HUNT = POWERHUNT (not common)
- POWER + RAISE = POWERRAISE (poker term maybe?)

4. Wait, what about "POWER ___":
- POWERS could be part of "Austin Powers"
- POWER + WALK = POWERWALK
- POWER + NAP = POWERNAP
- POWER + PLAY = POWERPLAY (not here)

5. Let me think about "___ NAP":
- POWER + NAP = POWERNAP
- CAT + NAP = CATNAP
- KID + NAP = KIDNAP!

6. This is interesting - "___NAP":
- CATNAP (CAT not here)
- KIDNAP (KID not here)
- POWERNAP (POWER... but it's POWERS)

7. What about card game terms:
- RAISE (poker action)
- FISH (Go Fish game)
- HUNT (scavenger hunt? treasure hunt?)
- JACK (playing card)

8. Playing cards:
- JACK (face card)
- Could others be card-related?

9. Let me think about TV shows or famous names:
- ARCHER (TV show)
- POWERS (Austin Powers, or Jessica Jones character Kilgrave's ability)
- HUNT (Hunt for Red October? Ethan Hunt?)

10. Activities/Actions that are compound words:
- TREASURE HUNT
- SCAVENGER HUNT
- SNIPE HUNT
- WITCH HUNT

11. "___HUNT":
- WITCH HUNT (WITCH not here)
- TREASURE HUNT (TREASURE not here)

12. Let me reconsider - things that can come before WALK:
- POWER + WALK = POWERWALK
- CAKE + WALK = CAKEWALK (CAKE not here)
- Could FISH work? FISHWALK? No.
- BOARD + WALK = BOARDWALK (BOARD not here)

13. Types of card games or card terms:
- FISH (Go Fish)
- JACK (playing card)
- RAISE (poker action)
- CRANK (not a card term I know)

14. Let me think about "POWER___" or "___POWER":
- If it's POWERS without the S, could work with:
- POWER NAP
- POWER WALK
- POWER RAISE (poker)
- POWER HIKE?

Actually, let me think about words that can follow POWER (using POWERS as POWER):
- POWER NAP
- POWER WALK  
- POWER PLAY (not here)
- POWER RANGER (not here)

Hmm, but it says POWERS, not POWER. Let me reconsider.

15. Famous Archers or people with these names:
- ARCHER (Sterling Archer, or the TV show)
- HUNT (Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible)
- PEEL (Emma Peel from The Avengers)
- POWERS (Austin Powers)

These are all spy/secret agent characters!
- Sterling Archer (Archer)
- Ethan Hunt (Mission Impossible)
- Emma Peel (The Avengers - 1960s TV show)
- Austin Powers (Austin Powers movies)

This seems very strong!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Possible connections:
- Could they all be Bill Murray movies? RUSHMORE definitely is. Let me think...
- Could they all be Wes Anderson related?
- Could they all have a compound word pattern?
- Could they share a common word that can precede or follow them?

Wait - could these all be words that can follow "ORANGE"?
- ORANGE CREAMSICLE (yes! That's a thing)
- ORANGE KISSCAM (no, doesn't work)
- ORANGE JOURNEYMAN (no)
- ORANGE RUSHMORE (no)

Hmm, what about words that can be preceded by a color?
- CREAMSICLE (orange and white popsicle)
- 

Let me think about other patterns:
Could they all be things with "CRUSH" in them?
- ORANGE CRUSH (drink)
- 

Wait! What if they can all be preceded by "ORANGE"?
- ORANGE CRUSH (soda)
- No wait, CRUSH isn't here.

Actually, let me think: could these all complete "ORANGE ____"?
- ORANGE CREAMSICLE (possibly, though usually just Creamsicle)
- ORANGE JULIUS (not JOURNEYMAN)

Hmm, or can they all follow a word ending in "ORANGE"?

I need to be more careful.

Remaining 8 words:
BUMPER, FERRIS, PEE-WEE, BABY, BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, INDIANA

Let me think more systematically about what could connect exactly 4 of these.

Let me consider compound words or phrases more carefully:

**Words that can precede "BLUE":**
- BABY blue (color)
- HEATHER blue? No, it's heather gray
- RUBBER... no
- INDIANA... no

**Words that precede common words:**

What about "_____-GO-ROUND" or carnival rides?
- MERRY-go-round (already used)
- Could any of these work? No.

Let me think about **famous people's first names** differently:
- FERRIS (Bueller)
- INDIANA (Jones)
- HEATHER (Locklear, Graham, etc. - famous Heathers)
- BABY (Spice - Baby Spice from Spice Girls!)

Or wait, could they be Spice Girls?
- BABY Spice
- Could others be? GINGER Spice... but I don't have GINGER
- SPORTY, SCARY, POSH... none of these are here

Hmm, what about **types of carriages or vehicles:**
- BUGGY (baby buggy, dune buggy)
- BABY (baby carriage)
- Could RUBBER buggy? No...

**Words meaning LARGE/ABUNDANT:**
- BUMPER (as in bumper crop - exceptionally large)
- Could others mean large? Not really.

Let me think about **HEATHER** specifically:
- Heather gray (color)
- Heather (plant)
- Heather (name)

What if these are all **types of gray/colors:**
- HEATHER gray
- RUBBER... no
- BABY blue is a color, but not gray

**Words that can be types of pools:**
- BABY pool
- BUMPER pool (a game)
- RUBBER pool? No
- Could BUGGY pool? No

Wait! Let me reconsider **BUGGY**:
- BABY buggy
- DUNE buggy
- BUGGY whip

And **RUBBER:**
- RUBBER band
- RUBBER duck
- RUBBER match

Could these be words that go with BAND?
- RUBBER band
- BABY band? No
- BUMPER... no

Let me try thinking: **Words that precede BLUES:**
- BABY blues (eye color or sadness)
- HEATHER... no
- RUBBER... no
- INDIANA... no

I'm going to try: BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, BUMPER - maybe these are all adjectives or materials?

Actually wait - could these be **basketball-related terms or players:**
- RUBBER (rubber match)
- INDIANA (Pacers)
- Could be state teams?

Let me try: **State/place-based:**
- INDIANA (state)
- Could others be states or places? FERRIS (Texas)? No...

I'll try: BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, BUMPER</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Those were Aladdin characters.

Remaining words: SAMURAI, CANDLES, FANTASTIC, DROP, LAG, FREEZE, ECHO, APOLLO

Now with 8 words left, I need to find the next group of 4.

Let me think about potential categories:

1. **Words that can follow a common word**:
   - "JET" - JET LAG, JET DROP (?)
   - "TIME" - TIME LAG, TIME FREEZE (?)
   - "MIC" - MIC DROP
   - "EAR" - EAR DROP
   
2. **"MR. ___" pattern**:
   - MR. FANTASTIC (Fantastic Four character)
   - MR. FREEZE (Batman villain)
   - MR. APOLLO? (Rocky character - Apollo Creed!)
   - MR. ECHO? (doesn't work)
   - MR. SAMURAI? (doesn't work)

Wait, let me think about this differently:

3. **"___ DROP"**:
   - MIC DROP
   - EYE DROP / EAR DROP
   - What else?

4. **Greek/Space related**:
   - APOLLO (Apollo missions, Greek god)
   - ECHO (Greek nymph)

5. **"SIXTEEN ___"**:
   - SIXTEEN CANDLES (movie)
   - SIXTEEN SAMURAI? (Seven Samurai is a movie...)

6. **Movie titles with numbers**:
   - SIXTEEN CANDLES
   - SEVEN SAMURAI
   - APOLLO 13
   - FANTASTIC FOUR

Wait! This could be it - movies with numbers in the title:
- SIXTEEN CANDLES
- SEVEN SAMURAI  
- APOLLO 13
- FANTASTIC FOUR

But I need to verify - the pattern would be "[NUMBER] [WORD]":
- FANTASTIC FOUR (Fantastic Four)
- APOLLO (Apollo 13)
- SAMURAI (Seven Samurai)
- CANDLES (Sixteen Candles)

This seems very strong!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: HACK, SHRINK, SUIT, COPPER

These must form the final group. Let me think about what connects them:

- SHRINK - slang for psychiatrist/therapist
- SUIT - slang for businessperson/lawyer
- COPPER - slang for police officer
- HACK - slang for taxi driver or a bad writer/journalist

Yes! These are all slang terms for different professions/types of people:

   - JET DROP - not really
   - JET FREEZE - no
   - JET ECHO - no

2. **Words that can follow "TIME"**:
   - TIME LAG - yes

   - TIME DROP - not really
   - TIME ECHO - not really

3. **Words that can precede "TAG"**:
   - FREEZE TAG - yes! (children's game)
   - LAG TAG - no
   - DROP TAG - no
   - ECHO TAG - no

4. **Commands/Actions**:
   - DROP (drop it!)
   - FREEZE (freeze!)
   - ECHO (echo this)
   - LAG (not really a command)

5. **Computer/Network terms**:
   - LAG (network lag)
   - DROP (packet drop, connection drop)
   - FREEZE (computer freeze)
   - ECHO (echo command in programming)

The computer/network/tech terminology seems most likely! All four can be used in a computing context:
- LAG - network lag, input lag
- DROP - packet drop, frame drop, connection drop
- FREEZE - system freeze, screen freeze
- ECHO - echo command, echo in networking

Remaining 8 words:
BUMPER, FERRIS, PEE-WEE, BABY, BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, INDIANA

I've tried:
1. FERRIS, INDIANA, PEE-WEE, BABY (movie characters - incorrect)
2. BUMPER, PEE-WEE, RUBBER, BABY (incorrect)
3. BUGGY, HEATHER, RUBBER, BUMPER (incorrect)

So there are 2 groups of 4 remaining. Let me think about what I haven't tried.

Let me think about what connects words in a different way:

**Could these be words that follow a specific word?**

What about "_____ Herman":
- PEE-WEE Herman (comedian)
- Could others be ___ Herman? Probably not all 4.

What about compound words with a common second part?

**Words that can precede CAKE:**
- RUBBER... no
- BABY cake? No
- BUMPER... no

**Words associated with childhood/kids:**
- PEE-WEE (youth sports)
- BABY (infant)
- BUGGY (baby buggy)
- RUBBER (rubber ducky?)

Let me try: PEE-WEE, BABY, BUGGY, RUBBER

Actually, wait. Let me think about **nicknames or diminutives**:
- PEE-WEE (small)
- BABY (small/young)
- BUGGY (?)
- Could these all be nicknames?

Or what about **words that can describe someone small:**
- PEE-WEE
- BABY

Let me reconsider the remaining words and think about NYT Connections patterns:

Could there be a wordplay element? Like words that sound like something else?

**Words that rhyme with or sound like days/months:**
- No clear pattern

**Words related to textures or materials:**
- RUBBER (material)
- HEATHER (fabric texture)
- BUMPER (?)
- BUGGY (?)

**Words that can be adjectives describing a crop/harvest:**
- BUMPER crop (large)
- BABY vegetables (small/young)
- Could others work?

Let me think about **proper nouns - first names of famous people:**
- FERRIS Bueller
- INDIANA Jones
- HEATHER (Locklear, Graham)
- RUBBER... no, not a name

Could it be:
- FERRIS
- INDIANA  
- HEATHER
- BUGGY? (or BABY?)

Actually, let me think: BUGGY could be Bugsy (like Bugsy Malone or Bugsy Siegel)?

Let me try: FERRIS, INDIANA, HEATHER, BUGGY

Wait, or could BUGGY be a nickname? And these are all famous first names/nicknames:
- FERRIS (Bueller)
- INDIANA (Jones)
- HEATHER (famous name)
- PEE-WEE (Herman)

But I already tried FERRIS, INDIANA, PEE-WEE, BABY and it was wrong.

So maybe it's: FERRIS, INDIANA, HEATHER, BUGGY

That would leave: BUMPER, PEE-WEE, BABY, RUBBER

What would connect BUMPER, PEE-WEE, BABY, RUBBER?
- All can be adjectives describing size or type?
- BUMPER (large, as in bumper crop)
- PEE-WEE (very small)
- BABY (small)
- RUBBER (?)

Hmm, not quite.

6. Or "____ JACKS":

- WALK (to walk)
- RAISE (to raise)

14. "___TAIL":

- FISH + KNIFE = Not really
- Could be a diving term: JACKKNIFE dive

17. Wait, types of dives or swimming moves:
- JACKKNIFE (dive)
- Could FISH relate? (swimming like a fish?)

18. Let me think about automotive terms:
- JACK (car jack)
- CRANK (crankshaft)
- Could TAIL relate? (tailpipe, tailgate)
- HIKE (not automotive)

19. Or things that go before a common word - let me try systematically:

"___ UP":
- JACK UP
- CRANK UP  
- HIKE UP
- Could work!
- RAISE UP (redundant but could work)
- WALK UP
- Could NAP UP work? No.
- TAIL UP? Not really.
- FISH UP? Not common.

Let me try:
JACK, CRANK, HIKE, RAISE - all can be followed by "UP"
- JACK UP (lift something)
- CRANK UP (turn up volume/intensity)
- HIKE UP (pull up pants, or hike up a price)
- RAISE UP (lift up)

This seems promising!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now I have the final 4 words remaining:
FISH, NAP, WALK, TAIL

These must form the last category. Let me figure out what connects them:

1. They're all verbs:
- FISH (to fish)
- NAP (to nap)
- WALK (to walk)
- TAIL (to tail/follow someone)

2. Compound words with a common element:
- Could they all go before or after the same word?

3. "CAT___":
- CATNAP (CAT + NAP)
- CATFISH (CAT + FISH)
- CATWALK (CAT + WALK)
- CATTAIL (CAT + TAIL) - yes! This is a plant!

All four can be preceded by "CAT"!
- CATNAP (a short nap)
- CATFISH (a type of fish)
- CATWALK (a narrow walkway)
- CATTAIL (a marsh plant)

This has to be it!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
