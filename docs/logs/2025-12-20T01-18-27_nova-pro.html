The most coherent category appears to be "Verbs related to communication," which includes SAY, VOICE, SPEAK. However, I need one more word to complete the set.

&bull; Directions: DOWN
&bull; Communication verbs: SAY, VOICE, SPEAK
&bull; Voting-related: VOTE, CHOICE
&bull; Movement/condition: SHAKE, NATURAL, TIRE, WAFFLE, PUMP, STEAM, FLAT

Since the voting-related words were incorrect, I should focus on other potential categories. The fractions (WHOLE, QUARTER) seem like a strong category, but I need two more words. 

Considering the remaining words, HEEL could be part of a "body parts" category, but it doesn’t fit well with the fractions. DOWN could be part of a "directions" category, but again, it doesn’t align with fractions.

Another potential category is "Communication verbs" with SAY, VOICE, SPEAK, but I still need one more word. 

Given the available words, the most coherent category now appears to be "Communication verbs," which includes SAY, VOICE, SPEAK. I need to find one more word that fits this theme. 

After re-evaluating, I realize that VOTE could metaphorically fit into a "expressing opinions" theme, as voting is a form of expressing one's voice or choice.

7. DOWN - A direction or a soft fluffy material.
8. EQUIP - A verb meaning to provide with the necessary items for a particular purpose.
9. OUTFIT - A set of clothes or to provide with clothing and other items.

Potential categories:
&bull; Agencies (NOAA, NASA)
&bull; Brands/Organizations (SUBARU)
&bull; Parts of a roof (EAVE)
&bull; Directions/Materials (DOWN)

The "Agencies" category seems the most straightforward with NOAA and NASA. I need two more words that could fit this category. Considering the nature of agencies, "ABLE" and "EQUIP" don’t fit well. "GAME" could be a stretch if we consider entertainment agencies, but it’s not strong. "PARAMOUNT" is a strong fit as it’s a major entertainment company. Since "PARAMOUNT" is already used, I need to find another word that fits the "Agencies" category. "OUTFIT" doesn’t fit, so I’ll try another approach.

Given the limited options and the need to find a category that fits, I’ll try the "Brands/Organizations" category again with "SUBARU" and "N.F.L." and see if I can find two more that fit.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

4. <b>STAR</b>: Related to astronomy or celebrity.
5. <b>FRY, CHIP</b>: Related to food.

The category of "movement" seems plausible with DIP and DIVE, but I need two more words. The words ROCKET, LINCOLN, SENATOR, STAR, FRY, and CHIP don't fit well with DIP and DIVE.

Given the remaining words, the category of "food" seems plausible with FRY and CHIP, but I need two more words. The words DIP and DIVE could fit into the "food" category if considered as actions related to food (e.g., dipping food, diving into a plate of food).

I'll try the category of "food" with FRY, CHIP, DIP, and DIVE.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
