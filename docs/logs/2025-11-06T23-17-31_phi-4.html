Now, I need to identify another category using the remaining word:

Remaining word: RUSHMORE.

Since "RUSHMORE" is the only word left, it doesn't form a complete category by itself. However, it refers to Mount Rushmore, a monument. Given the constraints of the game, I need to consider if there might be an implicit connection or if I've overlooked a potential category.

Let's consider the context of "RUSHMORE":

- **RUSHMORE**: Refers to Mount Rushmore, a monument featuring the faces of four U.S. presidents.

Since there are no other words left to form a category, and "RUSHMORE" is a unique term, it might be the only word in its category. In this case, I can guess "RUSHMORE" as the sole word in its category, acknowledging that it doesn't fit the typical pattern of four words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let's analyze the words:

1. **EXPLETIVES, SWEARING, PROFANITY, FOUR-LETTER WORDS**: These words are related to language and specifically to words that are often considered inappropriate or offensive. "Four-letter words" is a common term for expletives or swear words.

2. **CHRISTMAS, MOUSE, HOUSE, MYSTERY**: These words seem more general and don't immediately suggest a common category.

3. **HERRING, MESH SHIRT, NECKLACE, EARRING, PLEATHER VEST**: These words are quite diverse, ranging from food to clothing items.

4. **OUROBOROS, HISTAMINE, STIRRING**: These words are more abstract or scientific, with "ouroboros" being a symbol, "histamine" a chemical, and "stirring" an action.

Given the analysis, the most promising category is related to language, specifically words that are often considered inappropriate or offensive. The words "EXPLETIVES," "SWEARING," "PROFANITY," and "FOUR-LETTER WORDS" all fit into this category.

Considering these words, one potential category is "CHEMISTRY OR BIOLOGY," as "histamine" is a chemical compound, and "stirring" can be related to laboratory or cooking processes involving chemical reactions.

Let's analyze the words:

1. **BAR, TABLE, LOUNGE, COUNTER, TAP**: These words are commonly associated with a place where drinks are served, such as a bar or pub.
2. **ALE, VEG**: These could relate to items found in a bar or pub setting.
3. **SWIPE, PINCH, SCROLL**: These words are more related to actions or technology, possibly indicating a different category.
4. **EEK, QUASH, CHILL, HIVE, BOOTH**: These words are more abstract or less directly connected to a single category.

Given the strong connection between the first group of words (BAR, TABLE, LOUNGE, COUNTER, TAP), it seems likely that they belong to the category of a "BAR" or "PUB" setting. The words ALE and VEG could also fit into this category as items typically found in such a setting.

Considering the rules, I should avoid repeating words once they are correctly guessed. Therefore, I will focus on the words that most strongly suggest a single category.

4. **EEK, QUASH, CHILL, HIVE, BOOTH**: These words are more abstract or less directly connected.

Since the previous guess focused on the bar/pub setting and was incorrect, I should consider other potential categories. The words SWIPE, PINCH, and SCROLL suggest technology or digital interactions. Let's explore this angle:

- **SWIPE**: Commonly associated with touchscreens or digital interfaces.
- **PINCH**: Another gesture used on touchscreens.
- **SCROLL**: An action performed on digital devices.

These three words suggest a category related to "DIGITAL INTERACTIONS" or "SMARTPHONES". Let's see if we can find a fourth word that fits this category:

- **CHILL**: Bees chill their hive to regulate temperature.
- **HIVE**: The home of bees.

We need two more words to complete this category. Let's consider:

- **QUASH**: This could relate to controlling or managing something, possibly in the context of beekeeping or hive management.

The most distinct and clear category here is the Disney princesses: Ariel, Merida, and Tiana. Arial is a typeface, but it sounds similar to Ariel, which might be a distraction. The remaining words do not fit as neatly into a single category as the Disney princesses do.

Considering the remaining words, Arial, Georgia, and Verdana are all typefaces. This is a clear and distinct category. I will now guess these three typefaces along with another word that might fit a similar category or theme.

The word "Ariel" was part of the previous guess and is a name, but it sounds like Arial, which might be a clue. However, since Arial was already used, I should consider another word that might fit with typefaces or a related theme.

The word "Aerial" could be considered due to its phonetic similarity to Arial, but it doesn't fit the typeface category. Instead, I will focus on the typefaces and see if there's another word that might relate to fonts or design.

Given the focus on typefaces, I will guess Arial, Georgia, Verdana, and RounDOFF. RounDOFF might relate to design or typography in terms of edge smoothing, which is a concept in font design.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Impact and Split are general terms, but they might relate to effects or actions, possibly in a creative or artistic context.

RounDOFF is related to engineering, specifically to the smoothing of edges, which might relate to design or aesthetics.

Let's analyze the words:

1. **PUMP, SHAKE, STEAM, TIRE, FLAT, HEEL**: These words are often associated with cars or vehicles. For example, you pump air into tires, shake a car when it's unbalanced, steam can be related to engine issues, and flat and heel are conditions of tires.

2. **SAY, SPEAK, VOICE**: These words are related to communication or speech.

3. **WHOLE, QUARTER**: These could relate to measurements or parts of something.

4. **CHOICE, NATURAL, DOWN, VOTE**: These words are more abstract and could relate to decision-making or natural processes.

Given the context of the game, the first set of words (PUMP, SHAKE, STEAM, TIRE, FLAT, HEEL) seems to form a coherent category related to cars or vehicles. I will focus on this category for my guess.

Now, let's select four words from this category:
- **PUMP**: Related to inflating tires.
- **TIRE**: A key component of a vehicle.
- **FLAT**: A common issue with tires.
- **HEEL**: Refers to the part of the tire that can wear out.

2. **SAY, SPEAK, VOICE**: These words are related to communication or speech.

3. **WHOLE, QUARTER**: These could relate to measurements or parts of something.

4. **CHOICE, NATURAL, DOWN, VOTE**: These words are more abstract and could relate to decision-making or natural processes.

Since the car-related guess was incorrect, let's explore another potential category. The words **SAY, SPEAK, VOICE** are clearly related to communication. Let's see if we can find a fourth word that fits with this theme:

- **SAY, SPEAK, VOICE**: All relate to verbal communication.
- **CHOICE**: This could relate to the idea of choosing words or expressing oneself.

1. **BURNS** - Could relate to fire, injury, or a person (e.g., Robert Burns).
2. **LAUNCH** - Could relate to starting something, space missions, or products.
3. **LORDE** - A musician, which might relate to music or debut.
4. **PREMIERE** - Often associated with the first showing of a film or event.
5. **N.F.L. PLAYER** - Related to American football.
6. **DEBUT** - The first appearance or performance.
7. **MOTHER** - A familial role.
8. **INTRODUCTION** - The act of introducing or presenting something.

15. **CLERGY MEMBER** - A religious role.
16. **PRESIDENT** - A political role.

Looking for connections, I notice several words related to roles or titles: BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, PRESIDENT. These are all positions of authority or leadership in different contexts (religious and political).

Another potential category is related to "debut" or "introduction": DEBUT, PREMIERE, INTRODUCTION, and possibly LORDE (as she had a notable debut in music).

Considering the overlap and the need for a coherent category, the religious roles seem to be the most distinct and fitting category. The words BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, and PRESIDENT all represent leadership roles in their respective fields.

Therefore, I will guess these four words as they fit the category of "Leadership Roles."</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

1. **BURNS** - Could relate to fire, injury, or a person.
2. **LAUNCH** - Starting something, space missions, or products.
3. **LORDE** - A musician, possibly related to music or debut.
4. **PREMIERE** - First showing of a film or event.

14. **M.L.B. PLAYER** - Baseball.
15. **CLERGY MEMBER** - Religious role.
16. **PRESIDENT** - Political role.

Since the religious roles didn't work, let's consider other connections:

- **DEBUT, PREMIERE, INTRODUCTION, LORDE**: These words are related to first appearances or performances. LORDE had a notable debut, and PREMIERE and INTRODUCTION are about first showings or presentations.

- **N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER**: Both are sports-related, specifically American sports.

- **SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK**: Both are associated with holidays.

Given the feedback, the category of "first appearances or performances" seems promising. DEBUT, PREMIERE, INTRODUCTION, and LORDE all fit this theme.

Since the previous guesses related to religious roles and first appearances were incorrect, let's explore other connections:

- **SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK**: Both are associated with holidays.

- **BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER**: All are religious roles.

- **PRESIDENT**: A political role.

Considering the feedback, the category of "American sports" seems promising. N.F.L. PLAYER and M.L.B. PLAYER are directly related to American football and baseball, respectively.

To complete this category, we need two more words related to American sports. Let's consider:

- **LAUNCH**: Could relate to the launch of a sports career or event.
- **DEBUT**: Could relate to a player's first game or season.

Thus, the words N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER, LAUNCH, and DEBUT could fit the category of "American Sports."

- **BIRD**: Could relate to a holiday symbol, such as a cardinal for Saint Patrick's Day.

Looking at these words, I notice that "TUT," "TSK," and "TUT TUT" are all related to sounds of disapproval. "FOLEY" is related to sound effects, which could connect to these expressions. However, "FOLEY" doesn't fit perfectly with the disapproval theme.

Another potential category is characters or nicknames:
- **AKEEM** (from "Coming to America")
- **KONG** (King Kong)
- **DONKEY** (from "Shrek")

2. **PEPPER, POTATO, CREPE PAPER**: These words are related to food or cooking. "PEPPER" and "POTATO" are ingredients, and "CREPE PAPER" is used in cooking or baking.

3. **TALK, BRAIN, SHAR PEI, TOOTH**: These words seem less obviously connected. "TALK" relates to communication, "BRAIN" to thinking, "SHAR PEI" is a dog breed, and "TOOTH" relates to dental aspects. No clear category emerges here.

14. **HOTEL** - A place for temporary accommodation.
15. **STICK** - A tool or object, often used for support or hitting.
16. **BIRTH** - The process of being born.

Considering these words, one potential category is "types of accommodations or places to stay." This category could include:

- **CRUISE** (as in a cruise ship, a type of accommodation while traveling)
- **LODGE** (a type of accommodation, often in a resort or mountain setting)
- **HOTEL** (a common type of accommodation)
- **HOUSE** (a place of residence, which can also be considered a type of accommodation)

These words fit well within the theme of places where people stay or live. I am confident in this category as it logically connects all four words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- **HYBRID** - A mix of two different things, often in biology or technology.
- **BLEND** - The act of mixing or combining.

Let's re-evaluate the words:

1. **Colors**: BLACK, BROWN, CREAM, BLONDE, PALE
2. **Light-related**: SUN, LIGHT, DIM, FAINT
3. **Actions or states**: BEAT, WHIP, FAINT, DIM
4. **Other**: WORD, POOL

Since the food-related category was incorrect, I should consider other categories. The actions or states category (BEAT, WHIP, FAINT, DIM) seems promising. These words can describe actions or conditions related to sound, light, or physical states.

I will now guess the four actions or states words: BEAT, WHIP, FAINT, and DIM.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
BEAT, WHIP, FAINT, DIM
