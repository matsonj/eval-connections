1. <b>DIVE, FLYER, WING, DUCK, FLY, FRY</b>: These words are related to flying or birds. "WING" is a common feature of birds and flying objects. "FLYER" and "FLY" are directly related to flying. "DUCK" is a bird that can fly. "DIVE" can be associated with birds diving into water.

2. <b>SENATOR, LINCOLN, RAM, FORD</b>: These words are related to notable figures or brands. "LINCOLN" and "FORD" are both U.S. Presidents and car brands. "RAM" could relate to a car model (RAM truck) or a historical figure (Ramesses). "SENATOR" is a political role.

2. <b>LAUNCH</b> - Could relate to starting something, space missions, or products.
3. <b>LORDE</b> - A musician, which might relate to music or debut.
4. <b>PREMIERE</b> - Often associated with the first showing of a film or event.

Another potential category is related to "debut" or "introduction": DEBUT, PREMIERE, INTRODUCTION, and possibly LORDE (as she had a notable debut in music).

Considering the overlap and the need for a coherent category, the religious roles seem to be the most distinct and fitting category. The words BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, and PRESIDENT all represent leadership roles in their respective fields.

Since the religious roles didn't work, let's consider other connections:

&bull; <b>DEBUT, PREMIERE, INTRODUCTION, LORDE</b>: These words are related to first appearances or performances. LORDE had a notable debut, and PREMIERE and INTRODUCTION are about first showings or presentations.

&bull; <b>N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER</b>: Both are sports-related, specifically American sports.

&bull; <b>LAUNCH</b>: Could relate to the launch of a sports career or event.
&bull; <b>DEBUT</b>: Could relate to a player's first game or season.

Thus, the words N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER, LAUNCH, and DEBUT could fit the category of "American Sports."

Let's review the words again:

1. <b>BURNS</b> - Could relate to fire, injury, or a person.
2. <b>LAUNCH</b> - Starting something, space missions, or products.
3. <b>LORDE</b> - A musician, possibly related to music or debut.
4. <b>PREMIERE</b> - First showing of a film or event.
5. <b>N.F.L. PLAYER</b> - American football.
6. <b>DEBUT</b> - First appearance or performance.
7. <b>MOTHER</b> - Familial role.
8. <b>INTRODUCTION</b> - Presenting something.
9. <b>BISHOP</b> - Religious role.
10. <b>POPE</b> - Religious role.
11. <b>BIRD</b> - Animal.
12. <b>SAINT VALENTINE</b> - Holiday.
13. <b>SAINT PATRICK</b> - Holiday.
14. <b>M.L.B. PLAYER</b> - Baseball.
15. <b>CLERGY MEMBER</b> - Religious role.
16. <b>PRESIDENT</b> - Political role.

Since the previous guesses related to religious roles, first appearances, and American sports were incorrect, let's explore other connections:

&bull; <b>SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK</b>: Both are associated with holidays.

&bull; <b>BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER</b>: All are religious roles.

&bull; <b>PRESIDENT</b>: A political role.

&bull; <b>BIRD</b>: An animal, possibly related to a holiday or symbol.

Considering the feedback, the category of "Holidays" seems promising. SAINT VALENTINE and SAINT PATRICK are directly related to holidays.

To complete this category, we need two more words related to holidays. Let's consider:

&bull; <b>BIRD</b>: Could relate to a holiday symbol, such as a cardinal for Saint Patrick's Day.
&bull; <b>INTRODUCTION</b>: Could relate to the introduction of a holiday tradition.

Thus, the words SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK, BIRD, and INTRODUCTION could fit the category of "Holidays."

I will guess these four words as they relate to "Holidays."</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let's analyze the words:

1. <b>ZIP</b> - Could relate to fast movement, a fastener, or a code.
2. <b>CAKE</b> - A type of dessert.
3. <b>TUT</b> - Could refer to a sound of disapproval or the Egyptian pharaoh.
4. <b>FOLEY</b> - A type of sound effect in film.
5. <b>FLY</b> - Could refer to an insect, the action of flying, or a nickname.
6. <b>COBRA</b> - A type of snake.
7. <b>RACE</b> - Could refer to competition, ethnicity, or a group of animals.
8. <b>DOLITTLE</b> - Refers to Dr. Dolittle, a character known for talking to animals.
9. <b>BAD</b> - Could refer to quality or a character (e.g., Bad Bunny).
10. <b>AKEEM</b> - Refers to a character from "Coming to America."
11. <b>TSK</b> - A sound of disapproval.
12. <b>SHAME</b> - An emotion or feeling.
13. <b>BARREL</b> - A container or a type of roll in gymnastics.
14. <b>KONG</b> - Could refer to King Kong or a brand of toys.
15. <b>TUT TUT</b> - An expression of disapproval.
16. <b>DONKEY</b> - An animal or a nickname for someone stubborn.

Looking at these words, I notice that "TUT," "TSK," and "TUT TUT" are all related to sounds of disapproval. "FOLEY" is related to sound effects, which could connect to these expressions. However, "FOLEY" doesn't fit perfectly with the disapproval theme.

Another potential category is characters or nicknames:
&bull; <b>AKEEM</b> (from "Coming to America")
&bull; <b>KONG</b> (King Kong)
&bull; <b>DONKEY</b> (from "Shrek")
&bull; <b>DOLITTLE</b> (Dr. Dolittle)

These words all refer to characters or nicknames, which seems like a strong category. Let's go with this category for our guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

16. <b>DONKEY</b> - Animal or nickname for stubbornness.

Since the character/nickname category didn't work, let's explore other potential connections:

&bull; <b>FOLEY</b> and <b>FLY</b> could relate to sound or movement.
&bull; <b>COBRA</b> and <b>FLY</b> could relate to animals.
&bull; <b>RACE</b> and <b>COBRA</b> could relate to speed or competition.
&bull; <b>BAD</b> and <b>AKEEM</b> could relate to characters or nicknames.
&bull; <b>TUT</b>, <b>TSK</b>, and <b>TUT TUT</b> relate to sounds of disapproval.

Considering the words again, I notice that "ZIP," "RACE," "FLY," and "COBRA" could all relate to speed or movement. "ZIP" and "FLY" directly imply fast movement, "RACE" involves speed, and "COBRA" can move quickly.

&bull; <b>LODGE</b> (a type of accommodation, often in a resort or mountain setting)
&bull; <b>HOTEL</b> (a common type of accommodation)

Let's analyze the words:

1. <b>BULL</b> - Could relate to animals, sports (e.g., bull riding), or idioms (e.g., "bull's-eye").
2. <b>OVER</b> - Preposition, could relate to positions or idioms (e.g., "over the top").
3. <b>THROUGH</b> - Preposition, could relate to movement or idioms (e.g., "through thick and thin").
4. <b>EGG</b> - Could relate to food, animals, or idioms (e.g., "egg on one's face").
5. <b>SHOT</b> - Could relate to photography, sports, or idioms (e.g., "in the shot").
6. <b>HARD TACO</b> - Food item, could relate to cuisine or idioms (e.g., "hard to crack").

8. <b>SLUG</b> - Could relate to animals, idioms (e.g., "slug it out"), or slow movement.
9. <b>DONE</b> - Could relate to completion, idioms (e.g., "done and dusted").
10. <b>BELT</b> - Could relate to clothing, idioms (e.g., "belt out"), or tools.

15. <b>WATCH</b> - Could relate to timepieces, idioms (e.g., "watch out"), or actions.
16. <b>COMPLETE</b> - Could relate to completion, idioms (e.g., "complete package").

Considering these words, a potential category is "Sports Terms." Let's see if we can find four words that fit:

&bull; <b>BULL</b>: Bull riding is a sport.
&bull; <b>SHOT</b>: Common in sports like basketball, soccer, etc.
&bull; <b>BELT</b>: Used in boxing (e.g., championship belt).
&bull; <b>LAP</b>: Common in racing sports.

&bull; <b>NATURAL</b>: Could relate to natural choices or processes.
&bull; <b>DOWN</b>: Could relate to voting down or choosing a direction.

The words used in the third guess were BLUSH, SWEAT, NOSE, and DYE. The remaining words are:

&bull; PACE

Let's analyze these remaining words for potential connections:

1. <b>PACE, TIGER, FIDGET</b>: These words could relate to movement or animals. "TIGER" is an animal, "PACE" can relate to movement, and "FIDGET" involves movement or restlessness.

Given the limited number of words left, the most logical connection is through the theme of "movement" or "animals."

I will focus on the words related to movement or animals: PACE, TIGER, FIDGET. Since I need to choose four words and only have three remaining, I will consider the possibility of a broader category that might include an implicit or related concept.

&bull; <b>PACE</b>: Related to movement.
&bull; <b>TIGER</b>: An animal.
&bull; <b>FIDGET</b>: Related to movement or restlessness.

To complete the set of four words, I will consider "NOSE" from the previous incorrect guess, as it can be associated with animals (e.g., a tiger's nose) or movement (e.g., sniffing or sensing movement).

These four words fit well within the category of "movement" or "animals," which is a logical and common category in the game.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Given the limited number of words left, I need to find a category that can logically connect these three words. Let's analyze them:

1. <b>PACE</b>: This word can relate to movement or speed.
2. <b>TIGER</b>: This is an animal, specifically a large cat.
3. <b>FIDGET</b>: This word relates to movement or restlessness.

Considering the theme of "movement," I can see a potential connection:

&bull; <b>TIGER</b>: An animal known for its movement and agility.
&bull; <b>FIDGET</b>: Involves movement or restlessness.

To complete the set of four words, I need to consider a word that can logically fit into this category. Since "NOSE" was previously used and didn't fit, I will consider "RATE," which can relate to speed or movement (e.g., rate of movement).

2. <b>BLUSH, NOSE, SWEAT</b>: These words are related to facial features or expressions.

3. <b>STOCKINGS, MASCARA, TOWEL, DYE, CLIP</b>: These words are related to personal care or clothing items.

1. <b>BAR, TABLE, LOUNGE, COUNTER, TAP</b>: These words are commonly associated with a place where drinks are served, such as a bar or pub.
2. <b>ALE, VEG</b>: These could relate to items found in a bar or pub setting.
3. <b>SWIPE, PINCH, SCROLL</b>: These words are more related to actions or technology, possibly indicating a different category.
4. <b>EEK, QUASH, CHILL, HIVE, BOOTH</b>: These words are more abstract or less directly connected to a single category.

Given the strong connection between the first group of words (BAR, TABLE, LOUNGE, COUNTER, TAP), it seems likely that they belong to the category of a "BAR" or "PUB" setting. The words ALE and VEG could also fit into this category as items typically found in such a setting.

Considering the rules, I should avoid repeating words once they are correctly guessed. Therefore, I will focus on the words that most strongly suggest a single category.

Given these considerations, I will focus on the potential connection between Arabesque, Aerial, Impact, and Split. These words could relate to movement or effects in an artistic or creative context.

Arabesque and Aerial both relate to movement or art, while Impact and Split could relate to effects or actions in a creative context. This forms a coherent category based on the remaining words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: Ariel, Georgia, Verdana, RounDOFF, Ariel.

1. <b>Ariel, Ariel</b>: These are the same word, so they must be part of the same category.
2. <b>Georgia, Verdana</b>: These are typefaces.
3. <b>RounDOFF</b>: Related to engineering.

Since Ariel is repeated, it must be part of a category. The typefaces Georgia and Verdana are another potential category, but I need four words.

Considering the remaining words, Ariel is a Disney princess, and Arial is a typeface. This suggests a connection between names and typefaces.

Given that Arial was part of a previous guess with typefaces, and Ariel is a Disney princess, I should consider the possibility of a connection between names and typefaces.

The words Ariel, Georgia, Verdana, and Arial (considering the phonetic similarity) form a coherent category based on names and typefaces.

1. <b>CHRISTMAS, HERRING, HISTAMINE, HOUSE, MOUSE, MYSTERY, OUROBOROS, STIRRING</b>: I need to find a category that connects four of these words.

Considering the words "HISTAMINE, STIRRING, OUROBOROS," I previously thought of a "CHEMISTRY OR BIOLOGY" category. To complete this category, I need to find a fourth word that fits.

"HISTAMINE" is a chemical, "STIRRING" can relate to mixing in a scientific context, and "OUROBOROS" symbolizes cycles, which can be a concept in scientific processes. 

The word "MOUSE" could fit here if we consider "lab mouse," a common subject in biological and chemical experiments. This would complete the category of "SCIENTIFIC TERMS OR CONCEPTS."

I am confident in this category because it logically connects the words through their relation to scientific contexts.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

2. <b>OUROBOROS, STIRRING</b>: These words are more abstract or scientific. "Ouroboros" is a symbol, and "stirring" is an action.

Given the words "CHRISTMAS, HERRING, HOUSE, MOUSE, MYSTERY," they all relate to common themes or elements in storytelling. For example, "Christmas" is a popular setting for stories, "mouse" could refer to characters like Mickey Mouse, "house" is a common setting, and "mystery" is a genre.

This category seems promising because it connects well-known themes and elements in storytelling.

Let's review the words that are still available:

1. <b>HERRING, HOUSE, OUROBOROS, STIRRING</b>: These are the words left to consider.

Let's analyze potential connections:

&bull; <b>HERRING</b>: A type of fish, often associated with food or seafood.
&bull; <b>HOUSE</b>: A place of residence, often a setting in stories or a physical structure.
&bull; <b>OUROBOROS</b>: A symbol representing cycles or infinity, often found in mythology or art.
&bull; <b>STIRRING</b>: An action, commonly associated with cooking or mixing.

Considering these words, one potential category could be "CULINARY OR COOKING," where "herring" is a type of fish often used in recipes, and "stirring" is a cooking action. However, "house" and "ouroboros" don't fit well here.

Another potential category could be "SYMBOLS OR CONCEPTS," where "ouroboros" is a symbol, and "stirring" could metaphorically represent a cycle or process. However, "herring" and "house" don't fit well here.

A more fitting category might be "PHYSICAL OR CONCEPTUAL ELEMENTS," where:
&bull; "HERRING" is a physical element (food).
&bull; "HOUSE" is a physical structure.
&bull; "OUROBOROS" is a conceptual symbol.
&bull; "STIRRING" is a conceptual action (process).

This category connects the words through their roles as either physical objects or conceptual ideas.

5. <b>MAMMOTH, COLOSSUS, WHALE</b>: These are related to large things or creatures. They could fit into a category like "Large Creatures" or "Large Objects."

6. <b>MOUND</b>: This is related to a heap or pile. It might fit into a category like "Landforms" or "Heaps."

Let's consider the words BOX, BASE, PLATE, and MOUND. These words can be associated with surfaces or structures. BOX, BASE, and PLATE are all surfaces or parts of structures, and MOUND can be considered a type of landform or structure. This could fit into a category like "Structures" or "Surfaces."

I will guess these four words as they seem to fit the category "Structures" or "Surfaces."</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: SCRATCH, STARE, SNICKER, MAMMOTH, COLOSSUS, WHOPPER, WHISPER, DENT, POINT, WHALE, DING, MAR

Let's analyze potential categories:

1. <b>SCRATCH, DENT, WHOPPER, DING</b>: These are related to damage or marks.

2. <b>STARE, WHISPER, POINT</b>: These are actions or verbs.

3. <b>SNICKER, WHISPER</b>: These are related to sounds or expressions.

4. <b>MAMMOTH, COLOSSUS, WHALE</b>: These are related to large things or creatures.

5. <b>MAR</b>: This is related to damage or marks, similar to SCRATCH, DENT, WHOPPER, DING.

Considering the words SCRATCH, DENT, WHOPPER, DING, and MAR, they all relate to damage or marks. This forms a strong category of "Types of Damage" or "Marks."

Remaining word: MAR

Since there is only one word left, it seems there might be an error in the remaining words list, or MAR is meant to be part of a category that has already been guessed. However, since all other words have been used in correct guesses, MAR must be part of a category that has been previously identified.

Considering the words related to damage or marks (SCRATCH, DENT, WHOPPER, DING, MAR), MAR fits into the category "Types of Damage" or "Marks."

Since all other words have been used, I will guess MAR along with three words from the previously correct category of "Types of Damage" or "Marks."

I will guess SCRATCH, DENT, WHOPPER, MAR as they fit the category "Types of Damage" or "Marks."</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
