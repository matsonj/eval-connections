1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Provide your response in this exact structure:

&lt;thinking&gt;
[Your reasoning]
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
[EXACTLY four words, ALL CAPS, comma-separated]
&lt;/guess&gt;

Available words: NASA, PARAMOUNT, EAGER, WILLING, OUTFIT, EQUIP, N.F.L., CANE, DOWN, ABLE, EAVE, PREPARE, NOAA, GAME, SUBARU, READY</div></div><div class="stats">prompt: 427</div></div><div class="row"><div class="bubble right"><div class="metahead"><span>RESPONSE</span><span>2026-02-25T03:07:05.793359+00:00</span></div><div class="body"><details><summary>Show thinking</summary><div class="thinking">Let me analyze these 16 words to find 4 groups of 4 related words.

Looking at the words:
NASA, PARAMOUNT, EAGER, WILLING, OUTFIT, EQUIP, N.F.L., CANE, DOWN, ABLE, EAVE, PREPARE, NOAA, GAME, SUBARU, READY

Let me look for patterns:

1. "Ready and willing" type phrase - EAGER, WILLING, ABLE, READY - these all describe being prepared/enthusiastic to do something. "Ready, willing, and able" is a common phrase.

2. Organizations with acronyms: NASA (space agency), N.F.L. (football league), NOAA (weather agency)... need a 4th. PARAMOUNT is a movie studio, SUBARU is a car company.

3. Things that can follow "SUGAR": CANE (sugar cane), DOWN (not really)... 

4. Let me think about logos with stars: SUBARU has stars in its logo, PARAMOUNT has stars, NASA has stars... 

5. Words that can follow a letter: N-ABLE (enable?), E-AVE (not really)...

6. Wait - companies/organizations with stars in their logos: SUBARU (Pleiades stars), PARAMOUNT (mountain with stars), NASA (has a star), N.F.L. (stars on helmets?)

7. OUTFIT, EQUIP, PREPARE - these are all about getting ready/preparing

8. Looking at CANE, EAVE, DOWN - these could be parts of something or follow something...
&bull; CANDY CANE, HURRICANE (hurri-CANE)
&bull; EAVE is part of a roof

9. Let me think about what could connect: CANE, EAVE, GAME, DOWN
&bull; HURRI-CANE, could these all follow "HURRI"? No...
&bull; SUGAR CANE, could they follow SUGAR? GAME doesn't work

10. What about words that can precede something common?
&bull; DOWN, GAME, READY - these could all precede "SET" or relate to football

11. Logos with stars: SUBARU (definitely has stars), PARAMOUNT (stars circle the mountain), NOAA (has a symbol), NASA (has stars)... Actually NOAA, NASA, SUBARU, PARAMOUNT might all have stars in their logos!

12. OUTFIT, EQUIP, PREPARE, READY - all mean to make ready? Actually OUTFIT and EQUIP mean to supply with equipment, PREPARE means to make ready, READY could be a verb...

Let me start with what seems most clear: EAGER, WILLING, ABLE, READY - these are all adjectives meaning prepared/enthusiastic. "Ready, willing, and able" is a famous phrase.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
EAGER, WILLING, ABLE, READY

Let me reconsider these words.

NASA, PARAMOUNT, EAGER, WILLING, OUTFIT, EQUIP, N.F.L., CANE, DOWN, ABLE, EAVE, PREPARE, NOAA, GAME, SUBARU, READY

So EAGER, WILLING, ABLE, READY is not the group. Let me think differently.

Maybe some of these words can follow or precede something:

1. Words that can follow "CANDY": CANE (candy cane)... 
2. Words that can follow a single letter to make a new word:
   - E + AVE = EAVE? No, that's not right
   - G + ABLE = GABLE? 
   - Actually: ABLE could become CABLE, FABLE, GABLE, SABLE, TABLE
   - EAVE could become HEAVE, LEAVE, WEAVE
   - EAGER could become... nothing comes to mind
   - CANE could become... 

3. Let me think about adding a letter at the start:
   - CANE → ACANE? No... but CRANE, PLANE...
   - Wait: H + CANE = ... no. But HURRICANE has CANE in it
   - EAVE: HEAVE, LEAVE, WEAVE (add a letter)
   - ABLE: CABLE, FABLE, GABLE, SABLE, TABLE (add a letter)
   
4. Words where you add one letter to the front to make a new word:
   - ABLE → TABLE, CABLE, FABLE, GABLE, SABLE
   - EAVE → HEAVE, LEAVE, WEAVE
   - EAGER → MEAGER (add M)
   - What else? CANE → ? 
   - GAME → ? 
   - DOWN → GOWN? No... 

5. Wait - adding a single letter:
   - ABLE + C = CABLE
   - EAVE + L = LEAVE  
   - EAGER + M = MEAGER
   - What about OUTFIT, EQUIP?

6. Let me think about logos with stars again:
   - SUBARU - definitely has stars (Pleiades constellation)
   - PARAMOUNT - stars around the mountain
   - NASA - has stars
   - N.F.L. - stars on some logos
   - NOAA - has a symbol with a star?

7. Words meaning to prepare/supply:
   - OUTFIT (verb: to equip)
   - EQUIP
   - PREPARE
   - What's the 4th? READY (verb)?

8. Actually, let me think about "_____ BEAVER":
   - EAGER BEAVER is a phrase!
   - What else? LEAVE IT TO BEAVER?

9. Hmm, what about rhyming or sound patterns?
   - CANE, GAME both have long A sound
   - DOWN, GOWN rhyme?

10. Organizations: NASA, NOAA, N.F.L., and maybe one more that's an organization? PARAMOUNT is Paramount Pictures...

11. Let me try: things with stars in their logos
    SUBARU, PARAMOUNT, NASA, N.F.L.? Or NOAA?

Let me try the "add a letter to make a word" theory:
&bull; ABLE → CABLE/TABLE/FABLE/GABLE/SABLE
&bull; EAVE → LEAVE/HEAVE/WEAVE
&bull; EAGER → MEAGER
&bull; CANE → CRANE? No that's adding R and changing... Actually ARCANE has CANE

Wait - maybe it's about what letter you add:
&bull; Add W: WILLING → SWILLING? No...

Let me try logos with stars: SUBARU, PARAMOUNT, NASA, NOAA</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

So 3 of SUBARU, PARAMOUNT, NASA, NOAA are correct for a "logos with stars" category, and one is wrong.

Let me think about which one doesn't fit and what might replace it:
&bull; SUBARU - definitely has stars (Pleiades)
&bull; PARAMOUNT - has stars circling the mountain
&bull; NASA - has a star element in logo
&bull; NOAA - I'm less sure about this one

What else could have stars in its logo?
&bull; N.F.L. - some teams have stars, but the NFL logo itself...
&bull; What about others?

Actually, let me reconsider. Maybe it's not stars but something else these organizations have in common?

Wait - maybe it's about the type of organization or their logos having something specific:
&bull; NASA = National Aeronautics and Space Administration
&bull; NOAA = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  
&bull; N.F.L. = National Football League
&bull; All start with "National"? But PARAMOUNT and SUBARU don't...

Let me think again about what unites SUBARU, PARAMOUNT, NASA and what the 4th could be:
&bull; All have stars? Then maybe N.F.L. instead of NOAA?

Or maybe one of SUBARU, PARAMOUNT, NASA is wrong:
&bull; SUBARU - stars (Pleiades, meaning "unite" in Japanese)
&bull; PARAMOUNT - stars around mountain
&bull; NASA - "meatball" logo has stars
&bull; What if it's not NASA? What could replace it?

Could it be about mountains instead of stars?
&bull; PARAMOUNT has a mountain
&bull; SUBARU? No
&bull; CANE - sugar cane? Candy cane?
&bull; DOWN - down coat? Feathers?
&bull; EAVE - part of roof

Let me try N.F.L. instead of NOAA (NFL logo doesn't have visible stars though...)

Actually, thinking about it more - many American symbols have stars. Let me try:
SUBARU, PARAMOUNT, NASA, N.F.L.

Or maybe it's SUBARU, PARAMOUNT, NOAA, N.F.L. and NASA is the odd one out?

I'll try replacing NOAA with N.F.L.:</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: EAGER, WILLING, OUTFIT, EQUIP, CANE, DOWN, ABLE, EAVE, PREPARE, NOAA, GAME, READY

Now let me find the next group.

1. Words meaning to prepare/supply equipment:
   - OUTFIT (verb)
   - EQUIP
   - PREPARE
   - READY (verb - to ready something)
   This could work!

2. Add a letter to make a new word:
   - ABLE → CABLE, TABLE, FABLE, GABLE, SABLE
   - EAVE → LEAVE, HEAVE, WEAVE
   - EAGER → MEAGER
   - CANE → ? CRANE? No... 
   - DOWN → GOWN? DROWN? No those don't work by just adding one letter at start
   - GAME → ? 

3. What about words that can follow something?
   - WILLING, ABLE, READY, EAGER - but this was wrong before
   - VIDEO GAME, CANE SUGAR...

4. Let me think about ___ + word patterns:
   - SUGAR CANE
   - Could there be a pattern with adding a word before?

5. Or word + ___ patterns:
   - GAME READY? GAME DOWN?
   - DOWN PAYMENT?

6. Let me reconsider the "add a letter to beginning" theory:
   - ABLE → add C/F/G/S/T = CABLE/FABLE/GABLE/SABLE/TABLE
   - EAVE → add H/L/W = HEAVE/LEAVE/WEAVE
   - What else could work?
   - CANE → add letter? CRANE would be adding R in middle
   - NOAA → ?
   - Actually wait - CANE has the letters to make other words?

7. What if it's about hurricanes?
   - CANE (hurriCANE)
   - What else relates to hurricanes?
   - NOAA tracks hurricanes!

8. Let me try verbs meaning "to prepare/equip":
   OUTFIT, EQUIP, PREPARE, READY

This seems like a strong group - all can be verbs meaning to make ready or supply with what's needed.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: EAGER, WILLING, CANE, DOWN, ABLE, EAVE, NOAA, GAME

Let me find the patterns:

1. EAGER, WILLING, ABLE - these were part of my first wrong guess with READY. So maybe these three go with something else, not a "ready and willing" type phrase.

2. Add a letter to make a new word:
   - ABLE → CABLE, TABLE, FABLE, GABLE, SABLE
   - EAVE → HEAVE, LEAVE, WEAVE
   - EAGER → MEAGER
   - What about CANE, DOWN, GAME, WILLING, NOAA?
   - CANE → adding a letter... CRANE? No that changes a letter
   - DOWN → GOWN? No, that changes D to G
   - GAME → AGAME? No...

3. Wait, let me think about adding a specific letter:
   - If we add "M": EAGER → MEAGER ✓
   - Add "M" to others? MABLE? MEAVE? MCANE? No...

4. What about different letters for each:
   - ABLE + letter at front = TABLE, CABLE, FABLE, GABLE, SABLE
   - EAVE + letter at front = LEAVE, HEAVE, WEAVE
   - EAGER + M at front = MEAGER
   - CANE + ? = ?

5. Hmm, what if some words can have a letter added to make an actor/celebrity name?
   - GABLE (Clark Gable) from ABLE
   - WEAVE (could be a name?) from EAVE
   
6. What about words that can follow "CANDY"?
   - CANDY CANE ✓
   - CANDY... what else?

7. Words that can follow "VIDEO"?
   - VIDEO GAME ✓
   - VIDEO... what else?

8. What about these relating to a common word that goes before them?
   - ABLE, WILLING, GAME could all follow "UN-"? UNABLE, UNWILLING, ... not UNGAME
   
9. Wait - what about words that follow the same word?
   - ___ CANE: CANDY CANE, SUGAR CANE, HURRICANE
   - ___ DOWN: TOUCH DOWN, BREAK DOWN, GOOSE DOWN, EIDER DOWN
   - ___ GAME: VIDEO GAME, BALL GAME, END GAME
   - ___ EAVE: ??? 

10. Words associated with hurricanes/weather:
    - NOAA (tracks weather)
    - CANE (hurriCANE)
    - DOWN (as in downpour?)
    - GAME? No...

11. What if it's about phrases with "WILD"?
    - WILD GAME ✓
    - WILD GOOSE (chase)... no GOOSE isn't here
    - WILD CARD... no

12. Could NOAA fit with ABLE, EAVE, EAGER somehow? Like hidden in words?
    - NOAA... 

13. Let me think about what 4-letter combinations might work:
    Group A: ABLE, EAVE, EAGER, + one more (adding a letter to make new word)
    Group B: CANE, DOWN, GAME, NOAA, WILLING

14. Actually - ABLE, EAVE, EAGER can all have a letter added to front:
    - ABLE → TABLE/CABLE/FABLE/GABLE/SABLE
    - EAVE → LEAVE/HEAVE/WEAVE
    - EAGER → MEAGER
    - What's the 4th? CANE → ? No... WILLING → ? No...

15. Wait - DOWN → ADOWN? GOWN? DROWN? None by adding to front...

Let me try: ABLE, EAVE, EAGER + GAME?
&bull; GAME → AGAME? No...

What about NOAA? Can we add a letter? SNOAA? No...

Let me think about this differently. What connects NOAA with the others?

Actually, maybe the categories are:
&bull; ABLE, EAVE, CANE, EAGER (add letter to make word?)
&bull; WILLING, DOWN, GAME, NOAA (something else?)

CANE - what if you add a letter? CRANE? That's substituting, not adding. SCANE? ACANE? No...

Hmm, let me try ABLE, EAVE, EAGER, and one of the remaining that can have a letter added to form a new word...

Actually - what about removing a letter or anagrams?

Let me try a different approach - maybe NOAA, CANE, DOWN, GAME share something.

Or WILLING, ABLE, GAME, EAGER share something - like "READY, WILLING, AND ABLE" but with GAME?

GAME can mean willing/ready as in "I'm game" (meaning I'm willing)!

So: WILLING, ABLE, GAME, EAGER - all mean "ready/willing to do something"!
&bull; I'm willing
&bull; I'm able  
&bull; I'm game
&bull; I'm eager

Let me try this!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

So 3 of WILLING, ABLE, GAME, EAGER are correct for a "ready/willing" type category.

Remaining words: EAGER, WILLING, CANE, DOWN, ABLE, EAVE, NOAA, GAME

Which one is wrong and what replaces it?
&bull; WILLING - definitely means ready/agreeable
&bull; ABLE - means capable
&bull; GAME - "I'm game" means willing
&bull; EAGER - means enthusiastic/ready

What could replace one of these? The remaining words are: CANE, DOWN, EAVE, NOAA

Could DOWN fit? "I'm down" is slang for "I'm willing/ready"!
&bull; "I'm down for that" = I'm willing

So maybe it's WILLING, ABLE, GAME, DOWN (all meaning "ready/agreeable")
And EAGER is not part of this group.

That would leave: EAGER, CANE, EAVE, NOAA for the last group.

What could connect EAGER, CANE, EAVE, NOAA?
&bull; Add a letter to make a word?
  - EAGER → MEAGER (add M)
  - EAVE → LEAVE, HEAVE, WEAVE (add L, H, W)
  - CANE → ? CRANE? No...
  - NOAA → ?

&bull; Maybe they're all hidden in longer words?
  - EAGER in... ?
  - CANE in HURRICANE, ARCANE
  - EAVE in HEAVEN, LEAVE, WEAVE, HEAVE
  - NOAA in... MINOAN? 

&bull; What if a letter can be added anywhere, not just the front?
  - CANE → CANOE (add O)
  - EAVE → LEAVE, WEAVE, HEAVE (add letter at front)
  - EAGER → MEAGER (add M at front)
  - NOAA → ? NOAH (add H)? But NOAH has different letters...

Wait! What if these are all words that become new words when you add a specific letter?
&bull; CANE + O = CANOE
&bull; EAVE + L = LEAVE (or H = HEAVE, W = WEAVE)
&bull; NOAA + H = NOAH? No, that's not how it works...

Hmm, let me reconsider. Maybe NOAA doesn't fit with that group.

What if the last group is CANE, EAVE, ABLE, EAGER?
&bull; All can have a letter added to front to make new word:
  - ABLE → CABLE, TABLE, FABLE, GABLE, SABLE
  - EAVE → LEAVE, HEAVE, WEAVE
  - EAGER → MEAGER
  - CANE → ? 

Actually CANE doesn't work for adding a letter to front...

Let me think about what else could work:
&bull; CANE - CANDY CANE, SUGAR CANE, HURRICANE
&bull; What if they're all parts of compound words or can follow the same word?

Wait - what if NOAA, CANE, EAVE, and something else all relate?
&bull; NOAA deals with weather
&bull; HURRICANE has CANE
&bull; EAVE is part of a house
&bull; ABLE?

I need to be careful with my last guess. Let me try:
WILLING, ABLE, GAME, DOWN - all slang/expressions for "I'm ready/willing"

This leaves EAGER, CANE, EAVE, NOAA which I need to figure out but let me see if this group works first.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Provide your response in this exact structure:

DROP, PARROT, MONKEY, ECHO, CANDLES, GENIE, FREEZE, LAG, SAMURAI, FANTASTIC, APOLLO, SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE, PRINCESS, MIME

Let me look for patterns:

1. Words that can follow "MOON": MOON DROP? MOON PARROT? MOONSHINE... Let me think about what can follow a common word.

2. "___ BARS" - MONKEY BARS, PRISONER BARS... hmm, not quite.

3. Things that can follow "MR." - MR. FANTASTIC (from Fantastic Four), MR. FREEZE (Batman villain)... 

4. Let me think about "MR." prefix:
&bull; MR. FANTASTIC (Fantastic Four)
&bull; MR. FREEZE (Batman villain)
&bull; MR. MIME (Pokemon)
&bull; MR. CLEAN? No, CLEAN isn't here.

Actually, wait - MIME could be MR. MIME (Pokemon)!

5. Pokemon characters? Let me check for "___ MAN" or other patterns.

6. "SIXTEEN ___" - CANDLES! Sixteen Candles is a movie.

7. Movies with numbers?
&bull; SIXTEEN CANDLES
&bull; APOLLO 13
&bull; Could there be others?

8. Let me think about "SAILOR MOON", "PRINCESS ___", "GENIE" (Aladdin)...

9. Disney/animated characters?
&bull; GENIE (Aladdin)
&bull; Could PRINCESS be a category?

10. Let me think about "ECHO" - could be Amazon Echo, or echo as in sound...

11. "LAG" - jet lag, time lag...

12. Wait, let me think about words that can follow a number or come before something:

Looking at possible "MR. ___" combinations:
&bull; MR. FANTASTIC (Marvel)
&bull; MR. FREEZE (DC)
&bull; MR. MIME (Pokemon)
&bull; MR. CLEAN? Not here...

Actually, looking for another pattern - what about costumes/Halloween costumes or things you dress as?
&bull; SAMURAI
&bull; SAILOR
&bull; PRISONER
&bull; REFEREE
&bull; PRINCESS
&bull; GENIE

These could all be costumes!

Let me think about "PARROT" - repeat/copy... ECHO also means repeat, MIME means copy actions, MONKEY (monkey see monkey do)...

PARROT, ECHO, MIME, MONKEY - all relate to copying/imitating!

That seems like a strong connection! Let me verify:
&bull; PARROT - to parrot means to repeat
&bull; ECHO - repetition of sound
&bull; MIME - to mime/imitate
&bull; MONKEY - as in "monkey see, monkey do"

This seems like a solid guess!

Other possible groups:
&bull; Apollo 13, Sixteen Candles, Fantastic Four... movies with numbers?
&bull; APOLLO (13), CANDLES (Sixteen Candles), FANTASTIC (Fantastic Four), SAMURAI (Seven Samurai?)... 
&bull; SAILOR (could be Sailor Moon?)

Let me go with the copying/imitating group first as it seems strongest.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me reconsider.

Let me look at other patterns:

1. "MR. ___" - Batman/Marvel villains or characters:
&bull; MR. FANTASTIC (Fantastic Four)
&bull; MR. FREEZE (Batman)
&bull; MR. MIME (Pokemon)
&bull; MR. CLEAN? Not here...

2. Movies with numbers in the title:
&bull; APOLLO (Apollo 13)
&bull; CANDLES (Sixteen Candles)
&bull; FANTASTIC (Fantastic Four)
&bull; SAMURAI (Seven Samurai)
&bull; PRISONER (The Prisoner? Or Prisoner of Azkaban - 3?)
&bull; SAILOR (Sailor Moon? Not a number...)

Let me check: Apollo 13, Sixteen Candles, Fantastic Four, Seven Samurai - all movies with numbers!

3. Wait, what about "MOON ___" or "___ MOON"?
&bull; SAILOR MOON
&bull; HARVEST MOON? DROP?
&bull; ECHO... no

4. What about words that go with "CELL"?
&bull; PRISONER (cell)
&bull; DROP (cell drop?)

5. Let me think about video/audio terms:
&bull; DROP (frame drop, drop in audio)
&bull; LAG (video lag)
&bull; FREEZE (screen freeze)
&bull; ECHO (audio echo)

These could all be technical issues with video/audio! DROP, LAG, FREEZE, ECHO - all problems with streaming/video calls!

6. Let me also consider "___ BARS":
&bull; MONKEY BARS
&bull; PARALLEL BARS? No PARALLEL here
&bull; PRISONER behind bars?

7. Disney characters:
&bull; GENIE (Aladdin)
&bull; PRINCESS (many)
&bull; Could others fit?

Let me try the movies with numbers theory:
&bull; APOLLO 13
&bull; SIXTEEN CANDLES  
&bull; FANTASTIC Four
&bull; SEVEN SAMURAI

That's 4! Let me try this.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: DROP, PARROT, MONKEY, ECHO, GENIE, MIME, FREEZE, LAG, SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE, PRINCESS

Let me look for patterns again:

1. "MR. ___" characters:
&bull; MR. FREEZE (Batman villain)
&bull; MR. MIME (Pokemon)
&bull; MR. CLEAN? Not here...

2. Video/audio technical issues:
&bull; DROP (frame drop)
&bull; LAG (video lag)
&bull; FREEZE (screen freeze)
&bull; ECHO (audio echo)
These all seem like problems with video calls/streaming!

3. What about costumes or dress-up categories:
&bull; SAILOR
&bull; PRISONER
&bull; REFEREE
&bull; PRINCESS
&bull; GENIE
These could all be Halloween costumes or dress-up outfits.

4. "___ BARS" or "BARS ___":
&bull; MONKEY BARS
&bull; PARALLEL BARS (no)

5. Let me think about "SAILOR MOON" - could there be a MOON connection?
&bull; SAILOR MOON
&bull; What else goes with MOON?

6. Wait, thinking about children's party themes or games:
&bull; FREEZE (freeze dance)
&bull; Could others fit?

7. Let me reconsider - what if there's a pattern with words that follow something like "COPY" or "REPEAT"?

Actually, I'm fairly confident in the video/audio issues:
DROP, LAG, FREEZE, ECHO - all technical problems in video conferencing/streaming

Remaining words: PARROT, MONKEY, GENIE, MIME, SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE, PRINCESS

Let me look for patterns:

1. "MR. ___" characters:
&bull; MR. MIME (Pokemon)
&bull; MR. REFEREE? No...
&bull; MR. PRISONER? No...

2. Costumes/Halloween costumes:
&bull; SAILOR
&bull; PRISONER
&bull; REFEREE
&bull; PRINCESS
&bull; GENIE
&bull; PARROT (could be a costume)
&bull; MONKEY (could be a costume)
&bull; MIME (could be a costume)

3. Let me think about what word could precede all of these:
&bull; SEA + ? : SEA MONKEY!
&bull; BARREL + ? : BARREL OF MONKEYS?

4. What about "___ BREAD"?
&bull; MONKEY BREAD!

5. Let me think about "BRASS ___":
&bull; BRASS MONKEY? (song/phrase)

6. What about Disney/animated characters?
&bull; GENIE (Aladdin)
&bull; PRINCESS (many Disney princesses)
&bull; SAILOR? 
&bull; PARROT? (Iago from Aladdin?)

7. Wait, what about "GENIE ___" or "___ GENIE"?

8. Let me think about phrases with animals:
&bull; PARROT
&bull; MONKEY

9. What if there's a pattern with "FRENCH ___"?
&bull; FRENCH MIME? No...

10. What about "KISS ___" or "___ KISS"?
&bull; PRINCESS (kiss a princess/frog)
&bull; SAILOR? (kissing sailor photo)

11. Wait, what about things that can follow "BRASS"?
&bull; BRASS MONKEY (song)

12. Let me think about the phrase "SAILOR, SOLDIER, TINKER, TAILOR..." - professions/roles

13. What if the pattern is "___ SUIT"?
&bull; MONKEY SUIT
&bull; What else?

14. Actually, let me think about "GREASE ___" or "___ GREASE":
&bull; GREASE MONKEY
&bull; ELBOW GREASE? No ELBOW here

15. Let me try "ORGAN ___":
&bull; ORGAN GRINDER + MONKEY

16. What about things associated with parties/children's parties?
&bull; PRINCESS (princess party)
&bull; MIME (entertainment)
&bull; MONKEY (monkey around)

17. Wait - what if these are all "___ IN THE MIDDLE"?
&bull; MONKEY IN THE MIDDLE (game)
&bull; REFEREE IN THE MIDDLE
&bull; No, that doesn't work for all.

18. Let me think about what can follow "STREET":
&bull; MIME (street mime/performer)

19. What about words that can precede "COSTUME"?
All of them could be costumes: SAILOR costume, PRINCESS costume, etc.

20. Let me think about "KISS THE ___" or games:
&bull; KISS THE PRINCESS? No...

21. Thinking about the remaining 8 words, I need to find two groups of 4.

Group possibility 1 - Things you might dress as at a costume party that are specific roles/characters:
SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE, PRINCESS, GENIE, MIME

That's 6, so I need to narrow down.

Group possibility 2 - Let me think about compound words or phrases:
&bull; SAILOR MOON
&bull; MONKEY BARS
&bull; PARROT... PIRATE'S PARROT?
&bull; MIME... STREET MIME?

22. What if there's a "___ MOON" category?
&bull; SAILOR MOON
&bull; HARVEST MOON? 
&bull; HONEY MOON?
&bull; PRINCESS? No...

23. Hmm, what about "BIRTHDAY ___"?
&bull; BIRTHDAY PRINCESS? (like a birthday girl)

24. Let me think about "THE ___":
&bull; THE GENIE
&bull; THE PRISONER (TV show!)
&bull; THE REFEREE

25. Actually, what about TV shows: "THE ___"
&bull; THE PRISONER (British TV show)
&bull; THE PRINCESS... Bride?

26. Let me think about what can follow "BARREL":
&bull; BARREL OF MONKEYS

27. What about "BARE/BEAR ___"?

28. Wait, I should think about "GREASE" again:
&bull; GREASE MONKEY
&bull; GREASE... GENIE? No.

I'm going to try: SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE, PRINCESS as people/roles you might costume as (or specific uniform-wearing roles)?

Actually, let me think more carefully. What if it's about specific phrases or expressions?

Could there be a "___ BREAD" connection?
&bull; MONKEY BREAD (yes!)
&bull; What else?

Let me try a different approach - MIME, GENIE, PARROT, MONKEY could all be associated with something...

Actually, PARROT, MONKEY, MIME - these all involve imitation/copying. But that was wrong before. Unless the 4th word is different...

Let me try: SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE, PRINCESS - all could be costumes with distinct uniforms.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

So either SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE, or PRINCESS needs to be swapped out.

Remaining words: PARROT, MONKEY, GENIE, MIME, SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE, PRINCESS

Let me think about what word should replace one of them:

Option 1: Replace SAILOR with something else
&bull; PRISONER, REFEREE, PRINCESS + GENIE? (all costumes?)
&bull; PRISONER, REFEREE, PRINCESS + MIME? (all costumes?)
&bull; PRISONER, REFEREE, PRINCESS + PARROT? 
&bull; PRISONER, REFEREE, PRINCESS + MONKEY?

Option 2: Replace PRISONER with something else
&bull; SAILOR, REFEREE, PRINCESS + GENIE?
&bull; SAILOR, REFEREE, PRINCESS + MIME?
&bull; SAILOR, REFEREE, PRINCESS + PARROT?
&bull; SAILOR, REFEREE, PRINCESS + MONKEY?

Option 3: Replace REFEREE with something else
&bull; SAILOR, PRISONER, PRINCESS + GENIE?
&bull; SAILOR, PRISONER, PRINCESS + MIME?
&bull; SAILOR, PRISONER, PRINCESS + PARROT?
&bull; SAILOR, PRISONER, PRINCESS + MONKEY?

Option 4: Replace PRINCESS with something else
&bull; SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE + GENIE?
&bull; SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE + MIME?
&bull; SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE + PARROT?
&bull; SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE + MONKEY?

Let me think about what the connection might be:

Could it be "KISS" related?
&bull; KISS THE PRINCESS (fairy tale)
&bull; KISS THE REFEREE? No...

What about "___ BRIDE"?
&bull; PRINCESS BRIDE (movie!)
&bull; What else?

Could it be "THE ___ BRIDE" or "THE ___ DIARIES"?
&bull; THE PRINCESS DIARIES
&bull; THE PRISONER? 

Let me think about Disney or animated characters:
&bull; GENIE (Aladdin)
&bull; PRINCESS (many Disney)
&bull; Could SAILOR be part of this? (Sailor Moon isn't Disney)

What about "FRENCH ___"?
&bull; FRENCH MIME? Not really a phrase
&bull; FRENCH KISS? No KISS here

What about words that can follow "THE"?
&bull; THE PRISONER (TV show)
&bull; THE PRINCESS (fairy tales)
&bull; THE REFEREE
&bull; THE SAILOR

What if it's about "MONKEY ___" or "___ MONKEY"?
&bull; BRASS MONKEY
&bull; GREASE MONKEY
&bull; MONKEY BARS
&bull; SEA MONKEY

Wait! What about things that can follow "SEA"?
&bull; SEA MONKEY (yes!)
&bull; SEA GENIE? No
&bull; SEA SAILOR? No...

Hmm, what about "BARREL ___" or "___ BARREL"?
&bull; BARREL OF MONKEYS
&bull; BARREL ROLL? No ROLL

Let me think about "BRASS ___":
&bull; BRASS MONKEY (expression for cold weather)

What about party games or children's activities?
&bull; FREEZE (already used)
&bull; Could others be games?

Actually, let me think about what these could all precede or follow:

"___ KISS":
&bull; No clear pattern

Could these all be types of costumes with stripes?
&bull; PRISONER (striped uniform)
&bull; REFEREE (striped shirt)
&bull; SAILOR (sometimes striped)
&bull; MIME (often striped)

MIME! Mimes often wear striped shirts like prisoners and referees!

Let me try: PRISONER, REFEREE, MIME + one more with stripes
&bull; SAILOR can have stripes too

So: PRISONER, REFEREE, MIME, SAILOR - all wear stripes!

Wait, but I had SAILOR before. Let me think about replacing PRINCESS with MIME.

SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE, MIME - all could wear striped costumes!

Looking at the words:
NECKLACE, EARRING, MESH SHIRT, EXPLETIVES, PROFANITY, MYSTERY, STIRRING, SWEARING, CHRISTMAS, FOUR-LETTER WORDS, OUROBOROS, HISTAMINE, PLEATHER VEST, HOUSE, HERRING, MOUSE

First, I notice some words related to cursing/bad language:
&bull; EXPLETIVES
&bull; PROFANITY
&bull; SWEARING
&bull; FOUR-LETTER WORDS

These all mean curse words or bad language. That seems like a strong group.

Let me look for other patterns:

Words ending in "-ING":
&bull; EARRING
&bull; STIRRING
&bull; SWEARING
&bull; HERRING

Wait, but SWEARING might belong to the profanity group. Let me think more carefully.

Words that could follow "RED":
&bull; RED HERRING
&bull; RED... EARRING? No.

Actually, looking for compound words or phrases:
&bull; CHRISTMAS could go with something
&bull; HOUSE could go with something
&bull; MOUSE could go with something

"___ PARTY" words?
&bull; HOUSE PARTY
&bull; CHRISTMAS PARTY
&bull; Could MYSTERY PARTY work?

Let me think about "RING" words:
&bull; EARRING (contains RING)
&bull; STIRRING (contains RING)
&bull; HERRING (contains RING)
&bull; What else has RING? 

Actually, words containing "RING":
&bull; EARRING
&bull; STIRRING
&bull; HERRING
&bull; SWEARING (RING? No, just -ING)

Hmm, let me reconsider. Words with hidden "RING":
&bull; EARRING (EAR + RING)
&bull; STIRRING (STIR + RING)
&bull; HERRING (HER + RING)
&bull; SWEARING? No... but wait, maybe another pattern.

What about things that can follow a word?
&bull; NECKLACE, EARRING - jewelry
&bull; MESH SHIRT, PLEATHER VEST - clothing items, specifically stereotypical items someone might wear (like at a club or certain fashion)

Let me think about "things a certain type of person wears" - like stereotypical club wear or certain fashion:
&bull; MESH SHIRT
&bull; PLEATHER VEST
&bull; NECKLACE
&bull; EARRING?

Or maybe they're all things associated with a particular person/character?

OUROBOROS is a snake eating its own tail - a symbol of infinity/cyclicality.

Let me think about "____ MUSIC" or music genres:
&bull; HOUSE (HOUSE MUSIC)
&bull; MYSTERY? No
&bull; CHRISTMAS (CHRISTMAS MUSIC)

Or TV show types:
&bull; MYSTERY (Mystery shows)
&bull; HOUSE (House MD?)

Let me reconsider hidden words:
&bull; HISTAMINE contains "HIST" and "AMINE"
&bull; Could words contain hidden chemical elements or something?

Words that sound like they have animals:
&bull; MOUSE
&bull; HERRING (fish)

I'm going to start with the profanity synonyms since that seems most solid:
EXPLETIVES, PROFANITY, SWEARING, FOUR-LETTER WORDS

Actually wait - let me check if these all truly mean the same thing:
&bull; EXPLETIVES = curse words ✓
&bull; PROFANITY = curse words ✓
&bull; SWEARING = curse words ✓
&bull; FOUR-LETTER WORDS = curse words ✓

This seems like a very strong group. Let me go with this first.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
EXPLETIVES, PROFANITY, SWEARING, FOUR-LETTER WORDS

Now I have 12 words left:

NECKLACE, EARRING, MESH SHIRT, MYSTERY, STIRRING, CHRISTMAS, OUROBOROS, HISTAMINE, PLEATHER VEST, HOUSE, HERRING, MOUSE

Let me look for patterns again.

Words containing "RING":
&bull; EARRING (EAR-RING)
&bull; STIRRING (STIR-RING)
&bull; HERRING (HER-RING)
&bull; Need one more... 

Looking at the remaining words for hidden "RING":
&bull; NECKLACE - no
&bull; MESH SHIRT - no
&bull; MYSTERY - no
&bull; CHRISTMAS - no
&bull; OUROBOROS - no
&bull; HISTAMINE - no
&bull; PLEATHER VEST - no
&bull; HOUSE - no
&bull; MOUSE - no

Hmm, none of the others have "RING" hidden in them. Let me think differently.

What about "___ MUSIC" genres:
&bull; HOUSE (HOUSE MUSIC)
&bull; CHRISTMAS (CHRISTMAS MUSIC)
&bull; MYSTERY? Not really a music genre

What about types of parties or events?
&bull; HOUSE PARTY
&bull; CHRISTMAS PARTY
&bull; ?

Let me think about things that can precede another word:
&bull; MOUSE + ? (MOUSE TRAP, MOUSE PAD)
&bull; HOUSE + ? (HOUSE MUSIC, HOUSE PARTY)

What about Doctor Who references or TV shows?
&bull; HOUSE (House MD)
&bull; MYSTERY (Mystery Science Theater?)

Let me think about things associated with certain characters or stereotypes.

Wait - what about things that are circular/loops?
&bull; OUROBOROS (circular snake)
&bull; NECKLACE (circular)
&bull; EARRING (circular, like a hoop)
&bull; ?

Let me think about "_____ TRAP":
&bull; MOUSE TRAP
&bull; ?

What about Disney movies or animated films?
&bull; CHRISTMAS (A Christmas Carol?)
&bull; HOUSE (House of Mouse?)
&bull; MYSTERY (?)

Hmm, what about music/EDM genres:
&bull; HOUSE
&bull; ?

Let me think about words that can follow "CHRISTMAS":
&bull; CHRISTMAS PARTY
&bull; CHRISTMAS MUSIC
&bull; CHRISTMAS TREE

Or precede something else... like "___ TREE":
&bull; CHRISTMAS TREE
&bull; ?

What about compound words with animals or items that go with something?

Let me reconsider - looking for "_____ CAT" or cat-related:
&bull; MYSTERY? No
&bull; HOUSE CAT? Maybe
&bull; MOUSE (cats chase mice)

What about things in the game "Clue":
&bull; MYSTERY (it's a mystery game)
&bull; ?

Let me think about hidden words again or things that sound alike:
&bull; HISTAMINE - sounds like "HIST-A-MINE"
&bull; Could these be musical terms? HIS-TA-MINE?

What about words containing musical notes or something?

Actually, let me think about "____ OF ____":
&bull; HOUSE OF MOUSE (Disney)
&bull; MYSTERY OF... 

Things that are rings/circular shapes:
&bull; OUROBOROS (ring shape)
&bull; NECKLACE (ring around neck)
&bull; EARRING (ring in ear)
&bull; What else could be a ring? STIRRING has ring but...

Wait - things that are literally rings or circles:
&bull; OUROBOROS
&bull; NECKLACE
&bull; EARRING
&bull; HISTAMINE? No...

Let me think about Guy Fieri or specific person's attire:
&bull; MESH SHIRT
&bull; PLEATHER VEST  
&bull; NECKLACE
&bull; Could EARRING fit? Or something about flames/spiky hair?

This could be "things Guy Fieri wears" or similar celebrity fashion!

Let me try: MESH SHIRT, PLEATHER VEST, NECKLACE, EARRING - things you might see on a specific type of person or character.

Actually, I'll go with this fashion/clothing accessories group.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now I have 8 words left:

MYSTERY, STIRRING, CHRISTMAS, OUROBOROS, HISTAMINE, HOUSE, HERRING, MOUSE

I need to find 2 groups of 4.

Let me look for patterns:

Words containing hidden "RING":
&bull; STIRRING (STIR-RING)
&bull; HERRING (HER-RING)
&bull; What about the others?
&bull; OUROBOROS - no RING
&bull; HISTAMINE - no RING

Hmm, but I need 4 words with RING hidden in them.

Wait, let me check more carefully:
&bull; STIRRING = STIR + RING ✓
&bull; HERRING = HER + RING ✓
&bull; EARRING was already used

What about compound "RING" words or things associated with rings?

Let me think differently. What about "___ CAROL" or Christmas-related:
&bull; CHRISTMAS CAROL
&bull; ?

What about "A _____" (movies or books starting with "A"):
&bull; A CHRISTMAS Carol
&bull; A MYSTERY?

What about types of music or genres:
&bull; HOUSE (music)
&bull; CHRISTMAS (music)
&bull; ?

Let me think about what could connect MYSTERY, CHRISTMAS, HOUSE...
&bull; MYSTERY HOUSE?
&bull; CHRISTMAS HOUSE?

What if they all can precede the same word?
&bull; MYSTERY + ? 
&bull; CHRISTMAS + ?
&bull; HOUSE + ?
&bull; MOUSE + ?

MOUSE HOUSE? Like a rhyme?

Or they can all follow "___":
&bull; FULL HOUSE
&bull; ?

What about Disney:
&bull; HOUSE OF MOUSE
&bull; CHRISTMAS (many Disney Christmas specials)
&bull; MYSTERY (Disney mysteries?)

Let me think about "_____ MUSIC":
&bull; HOUSE MUSIC ✓
&bull; CHRISTMAS MUSIC ✓
&bull; ?

What about words that can precede "PARTY":
&bull; HOUSE PARTY
&bull; CHRISTMAS PARTY
&bull; ?

Let me think about Dr. Seuss or rhyming:
&bull; MOUSE / HOUSE (rhyme, like in Dr. Seuss)
&bull; CHRISTMAS (How the Grinch Stole Christmas)
&bull; MYSTERY?

What about things that end in similar sounds:
&bull; HOUSE, MOUSE (rhyme with -OUSE)
&bull; HISTAMINE, ?

Checking for hidden words:
&bull; HISTAMINE: HIS + TAM + INE or HIST + AMINE
&bull; Could there be hidden "HIS" or "HIST" or "AMINE"?

Actually wait - what about hidden "AMINE" (chemical suffix):
&bull; HISTAMINE has AMINE
&bull; Do others have AMINE? No...

Let me think about things with "HIS" hidden:
&bull; HISTAMINE (HIS-tamine)
&bull; CHRISTMAS (Chr-IS-tmas)? Not quite "HIS"

What about medical/allergy related:
&bull; HISTAMINE (allergy chemical)
&bull; ?

Let me reconsider the "RING" pattern:
Looking for words where you can find RING:
&bull; STIRRING ✓
&bull; HERRING ✓
&bull; Need 2 more from: MYSTERY, CHRISTMAS, OUROBOROS, HISTAMINE, HOUSE, MOUSE

Hmm, none of these have RING in them directly.

What about things that are circular symbols or loops:
&bull; OUROBOROS (circular snake)
&bull; STIRRING (circular motion)
&bull; ?

Wait - what if the category is about things that contain "HER", "HIS", "OUR", "MY" (possessive pronouns)?
&bull; HERRING = HER + RING
&bull; HISTAMINE = HIS + TAMINE
&bull; OUROBOROS = OUR + OBOROS
&bull; MYSTERY = MY + STERY

That's 4! Hidden possessive pronouns!
&bull; MY-STERY
&bull; HER-RING
&bull; HIS-TAMINE
&bull; OUR-OBOROS

Let me verify:
&bull; MYSTERY starts with MY ✓
&bull; HERRING starts with HER ✓
&bull; HISTAMINE starts with HIS ✓
&bull; OUROBOROS starts with OUR ✓

This seems very likely!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

STIRRING, CHRISTMAS, HOUSE, MOUSE

These must form the last group. Let me verify what connects them:

&bull; STIRRING
&bull; CHRISTMAS
&bull; HOUSE
&bull; MOUSE

Could these all precede or follow the same word?

"'Twas the Night Before Christmas" - the famous poem!
&bull; "Not a creature was STIRRING"
&bull; "CHRISTMAS" is in the title
&bull; "HOUSE" - throughout the house
&bull; "MOUSE" - not even a mouse

Yes! These are all words from "'Twas the Night Before Christmas" poem!

The famous line: "'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse."

This is definitely the connection!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.

4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

FIN, POPPER, WING, KIND, SWEET, TRIFLE, THROW, WARM, FRITTER, STOVETOP, FIDDLE, ARM, MICROWAVE, KETTLE, TENDER, FLIPPER

Let me look for patterns:

1. Body parts/appendages: FIN, WING, ARM, FLIPPER - these are all appendages/limbs
2. Cooking methods/appliances: STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, KETTLE - only 3 here
3. Words that can follow "CORN": POPPER (corn popper), FRITTER (corn fritter), KETTLE (kettle corn?)... hmm
4. Words that can follow a color or descriptor: 
   - KIND (one of a kind?)
   - SWEET (sweet corn?)
   - WARM (warm?)

Let me think about compound words or phrases:
&bull; POPCORN POPPER
&bull; CORN FRITTER
&bull; KETTLE CORN
&bull; STOVETOP POPCORN

Wait, what about words that go with "POPCORN"?
&bull; POPCORN: KETTLE (kettle corn), STOVETOP (stovetop popcorn)

Let me try another angle - words that can follow "LEGAL":
&bull; LEGAL TENDER

Words that go before "CORN"?
&bull; POPCORN, KETTLE CORN... 

What about appendages that can be on different animals?
&bull; FIN (fish), WING (bird), ARM (human/octopus), FLIPPER (dolphin/seal)

That seems like a strong group!

Let me think about what's left: POPPER, KIND, SWEET, TRIFLE, THROW, WARM, FRITTER, STOVETOP, FIDDLE, MICROWAVE, KETTLE, TENDER

Words that can follow a common word:
&bull; PARTY POPPER
&bull; PARTY ANIMAL? No...

What about "FIDDLE"? 
&bull; FIDDLE around, fiddle with

Words meaning "to waste time/mess around": FIDDLE, TRIFLE, FRITTER (fritter away)

Wait! Words meaning to waste or spend carelessly:
&bull; FIDDLE (fiddle around)
&bull; TRIFLE (trifle with)
&bull; FRITTER (fritter away)
&bull; THROW (throw away)

Hmm, that could work!

What about words that go with "WARM"?
&bull; WARM THROW (blanket)
&bull; WARM TENDER?

Let me think about "___ HEARTED":
&bull; KIND-HEARTED
&bull; WARM-HEARTED
&bull; TENDER-HEARTED
&bull; SWEET? No...

Actually, ___-HEARTED:
&bull; KIND
&bull; WARM
&bull; TENDER
&bull; SWEET? Nope, not really

What about words that can precede "CORN"?
&bull; POPCORN → POPPER, KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE
&bull; Actually MICROWAVE POPCORN, STOVETOP POPCORN, KETTLE CORN, POPPER...

POPCORN varieties/methods: KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, and... POPPER?

Let me try: KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, POPPER - all ways to make popcorn!

I'm fairly confident about:
1. Appendages: FIN, WING, ARM, FLIPPER
2. Popcorn related: KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, POPPER

Let me continue with my analysis:

1. Popcorn related: KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, POPPER - all ways to make/types of popcorn
   - KETTLE corn
   - STOVETOP popcorn
   - MICROWAVE popcorn
   - POPPER (popcorn popper)

2. ___-HEARTED words:
   - KIND-HEARTED
   - WARM-HEARTED
   - TENDER-HEARTED
   - SWEET? No, not really sweet-hearted...

3. Words meaning to waste/squander:
   - FIDDLE (fiddle away time)
   - TRIFLE (trifle with)
   - FRITTER (fritter away)
   - THROW (throw away)

Wait, let me reconsider ___-HEARTED:
&bull; KIND (kind-hearted) ✓
&bull; WARM (warm-hearted) ✓
&bull; TENDER (tender-hearted) ✓
&bull; SWEET? Not really... 

What about COLD? No, that's not in the list.

Let me think about SWEET:
&bull; SWEET TOOTH
&bull; SWEET HEART? 

Actually, wait - what about words that can come before a common word?
&bull; SWEET TOOTH
&bull; Can THROW, FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE all precede something?

1. ___-HEARTED words:
   - KIND-HEARTED ✓
   - WARM-HEARTED ✓
   - TENDER-HEARTED ✓
   - Need a 4th... SWEET? Not really "sweet-hearted"

2. Words meaning to waste/squander time or resources:
   - FIDDLE (fiddle away)
   - TRIFLE (trifle with/away)
   - FRITTER (fritter away)
   - THROW (throw away)

Wait, let me reconsider. What about words that can follow something?

LEGAL ___:
&bull; LEGAL TENDER ✓

What about SWEET, KIND, WARM?

Hmm, what if it's "_____ AWAY"?
&bull; THROW away
&bull; FRITTER away
&bull; FIDDLE away? (less common)
&bull; TRIFLE away? (less common)

Or words that go with a specific prefix/suffix?

What about ENGLISH ___?
&bull; No, that doesn't work.

Let me think about phrases with these words:
&bull; KIND regards
&bull; SWEET nothing
&bull; WARM regards
&bull; TENDER loving care

What can precede all of KIND, SWEET, WARM, TENDER?
&bull; BITTER? No...

What about "NOTHING"?
&bull; SWEET NOTHING ✓
&bull; KIND NOTHING? No

Let me think about compound words or phrases:
&bull; TRIFLE (dessert, or to waste)
&bull; FRITTER (food item, or to waste)
&bull; FIDDLE (instrument, or to waste)
&bull; THROW (action, or a blanket)

Actually, what if TRIFLE, FRITTER, FIDDLE, and one more are about wasting time?

Let me try: FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW - all can mean to waste (fiddle around, fritter away, trifle with, throw away)

Actually, I think the ___-HEARTED connection might need a different 4th word. What about COLD? No, not in list.

Let me reconsider with 8 words: KIND, SWEET, TRIFLE, THROW, WARM, FRITTER, FIDDLE, TENDER

Group 1: ___ AWAY (waste): FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW
Group 2: ___-HEARTED: KIND, WARM, TENDER, SWEET

Wait, is SWEET-HEARTED a thing? Let me assume it could be used in NYT Connections.

Available words: FRY, SCRAPER, DODGE, WING, LINCOLN, DUCK, DIVE, DIP, CHIP, LARK, STAR, ROCKET, FORD, FLYER, RAM, SENATOR</div></div><div class="stats">prompt: 424</div></div><div class="row"><div class="bubble right"><div class="metahead"><span>RESPONSE</span><span>2026-02-25T03:07:01.702979+00:00</span></div><div class="body"><details><summary>Show thinking</summary><div class="thinking">Let me analyze these 16 words to find 4 groups of 4 related words.

Looking at the words: FRY, SCRAPER, DODGE, WING, LINCOLN, DUCK, DIVE, DIP, CHIP, LARK, STAR, ROCKET, FORD, FLYER, RAM, SENATOR

Possible categories I can identify:

1. Car manufacturers/brands: FORD, LINCOLN, DODGE, RAM - these are all car brands (Ford, Lincoln which is owned by Ford, Dodge, and Ram which was part of Dodge)

2. NHL teams: FLYER (Philadelphia Flyers), STAR (Dallas Stars), DUCK (Anaheim Ducks), SENATOR (Ottawa Senators), ROCKET could be Houston Rockets but that's NBA... Let me think again.
   - Philadelphia Flyers
   - Dallas Stars
   - Anaheim Ducks
   - Ottawa Senators
   These are all NHL teams (singular form)

3. Words that can follow "SKY": SCRAPER (skyscraper), DIVE (skydive), LARK (skylark), ROCKET (sky rocket)? Or WING? Let me think...
   - SCRAPER → skyscraper
   - DIVE → skydive
   - LARK → skylark
   - ROCKET → sky rocket? Not sure

4. Words that can follow "NOSE": DIVE (nosedive)... hmm

5. Things with WING: chicken wing, buffalo wing...

6. Poker/card related: CHIP, FLYER?

7. Movements to avoid something: DUCK, DODGE, DIVE, DIP - these could all be evasive movements!

Let me reconsider:
&bull; DUCK (evasive move)
&bull; DODGE (evasive move)
&bull; DIVE (evasive move)
&bull; DIP (evasive move)

Wait, there's also the phrase "duck, dip, dive, and dodge" from Dodgeball movie!

Let me verify my groups:
1. Car brands: FORD, LINCOLN, DODGE, RAM
2. NHL teams (singular): FLYER, STAR, DUCK, SENATOR
3. "Dodgeball" moves or evasive actions: DUCK, DIP, DIVE, DODGE

But DUCK and DODGE appear in multiple categories. Let me reconsider.

If DODGE is a car brand, then the Dodgeball moves would need another word.
If DUCK is an NHL team, then the Dodgeball moves would need another word.

Actually, looking more carefully:
&bull; SKY + words: SCRAPER, DIVE, LARK, ROCKET? No, sky rocket isn't one word typically.

Let me think about what goes with FRY, CHIP, WING, DIP:
&bull; These could all be food-related or things you DIP
&bull; Actually: FRY, CHIP, WING could be bar foods... with DIP?
&bull; Or CHIP and DIP go together...

SMALL FRY, CHIP (poker chip, computer chip), WING...

Let me try: Words that can follow BUFFALO:
&bull; BUFFALO WING
&bull; BUFFALO CHIP (yes, this is a thing - dried bison dung used as fuel, or a casino)
&bull; BUFFALO... 

Hmm, let me try another approach:
&bull; POKER terms: CHIP, FLYER?

I'm fairly confident about:
1. Car brands: FORD, LINCOLN, DODGE, RAM

Let me start with this guess since I'm most confident.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
FORD, LINCOLN, DODGE, RAM

Let me reconsider my categories:

1. NHL teams (singular form):
&bull; FLYER (Philadelphia Flyers)
&bull; STAR (Dallas Stars)
&bull; DUCK (Anaheim Ducks)
&bull; SENATOR (Ottawa Senators)

This seems very strong!

2. Dodgeball moves (from the movie): "Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive, and Dodge"
&bull; But DODGE is already used, so this can't be a complete category now
&bull; DUCK, DIP, DIVE remain but we'd need a 4th

3. Words that can follow "SKY":
&bull; SCRAPER (skyscraper)
&bull; DIVE (skydive)
&bull; LARK (skylark)
&bull; ROCKET (skyrocket)

This also seems strong!

4. Remaining words would be: FRY, WING, DIP, CHIP, DUCK
&bull; Could these go with a common word?
&bull; BUFFALO: WING (buffalo wing), CHIP (buffalo chip)
&bull; SMALL: FRY (small fry)
&bull; BLUE CHIP, POKER CHIP
&bull; SKINNY DIP

Let me check if NHL teams works:
FLYER, STAR, DUCK, SENATOR - yes, these are all NHL teams!

I'll go with NHL teams next.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me identify the remaining two categories:

1. Words that can follow "SKY":
&bull; SCRAPER (skyscraper)
&bull; DIVE (skydive)
&bull; LARK (skylark)
&bull; ROCKET (skyrocket)

This seems very strong!

2. That would leave: FRY, WING, DIP, CHIP
&bull; What could connect these?
&bull; BUFFALO: WING (buffalo wing), CHIP (buffalo chip)
&bull; Could they all follow BUFFALO? 
  - BUFFALO FRY? Not really
  - BUFFALO DIP? Maybe as a recipe name
&bull; POKER: CHIP (poker chip)
&bull; SKINNY: DIP (skinny dip)
&bull; SMALL: FRY (small fry)
&bull; CHICKEN: WING (chicken wing)

Let me think of other connections:
&bull; BAR food/snacks?
&bull; Things you might find at a party?
&bull; CHIP and DIP go together...

Actually, could they all follow BLUE?
&bull; BLUE CHIP (yes!)
&bull; BLUE WING (maybe? blue-winged teal?)
&bull; BLUE FRY? No...

Could they all be types of something?
&bull; CHIP, DIP could be dance moves (salsa dancing has dips)
&bull; WING it, FRY...

Let me think about what comes BEFORE these words:
&bull; SMALL FRY
&bull; SKINNY DIP
&bull; BLUE CHIP
&bull; BUFFALO WING

These are all compound words with different first words though...

Actually wait - could these all be ___ AND ___?
&bull; FISH AND CHIPS
&bull; CHIP AND DIP
&bull; WING AND...

Let me try SKY___ first since I'm very confident about that:

&bull; POKER... no

&bull; COMPUTER... no

BUFFALO:
&bull; BUFFALO WING (yes)
&bull; BUFFALO CHIP (yes - dried dung or casino)

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

Looking at the words:
SCROOGE, CLASSICS, FOGHORN, WOODEN, AWKWARD, STILTED, CHUCK, CREATE, GUTHRIE, WOOD, WOODY, THEREFORE, COULD, STIFF, WOODSTOCK, WOODCHUCK

Let me look for patterns:

1. Words that could describe acting/performance style: WOODEN, AWKWARD, STILTED, STIFF - these all describe poor or unnatural acting/movement

2. Words containing "WOOD": WOODEN, WOOD, WOODY, WOODSTOCK, WOODCHUCK - but that's 5 words

3. Famous people named Woody: WOODY Allen, WOODY Guthrie... wait GUTHRIE is separate. Let me think about famous Woodys:
&bull; Woody Allen
&bull; Woody Guthrie
&bull; Woody Harrelson
&bull; Woody from Toy Story

4. Looking at FOGHORN, SCROOGE, WOODSTOCK - these could be cartoon/Peanuts characters:
&bull; WOODSTOCK (Snoopy's bird friend)
&bull; SCROOGE (Scrooge McDuck from DuckTales)
&bull; FOGHORN (Foghorn Leghorn from Looney Tunes)

5. Words that sound like they contain other words:
&bull; WOODCHUCK contains WOOD and CHUCK
&bull; THEREFORE contains THERE and FORE
&bull; COULD contains... hmm
&bull; CREATE contains... hmm

6. Wait, looking at hidden words:
&bull; THEREFORE = THERE + FORE
&bull; COULD = C + OULD... or contains "OULD"
&bull; WOODCHUCK = WOOD + CHUCK
&bull; CLASSICS = CLASS + ICS

7. Let me think about "___ WOULD" or "WOULD ___":
&bull; COULD sounds like "C + WOULD"
&bull; Wait, maybe words that sound like "WOOD" hidden in them?

8. Actually, looking at "WOOD" sound hidden:
&bull; WOODCHUCK (obvious)
&bull; WOODSTOCK (obvious)
&bull; COULD = "C" + sounds like "WOOD" + something? No...

Let me reconsider the "stiff acting" group: WOODEN, AWKWARD, STILTED, STIFF - these are all synonyms for unnatural/forced behavior. This seems like a strong category.

Looking at the words:
FICTION, GROUNDS, HAZEL, DOGS, GREEN, CHEST, UNCHAINED, COCO, FIELD, DIRECTOR, HEAD, LAWN, CHAIR, PEA, CHIEF, BROWN

Let me think about possible categories:

1. Colors: GREEN, BROWN, HAZEL (eye colors?) - need a 4th
   - PEA could be "pea green"
   - HAZEL is an eye color

2. Words that can follow "PULP": FICTION - "Pulp Fiction" is a movie

3. Django movies: UNCHAINED - "Django Unchained"

4. Pixar/animated movies: COCO (Pixar movie), could there be others?

5. Words that can precede "COAT": PEA (peacoat), maybe others?

6. Charlie Brown characters: BROWN (Charlie Brown), FIELD (?)

7. Words that can follow a color:
   - GREEN: field, lawn, grounds?
   
8. Types of furniture: CHEST, CHAIR

9. Executive positions: DIRECTOR, CHIEF, HEAD, CHAIR - these could all be executive/leadership titles!
   - Executive Director, Chief Executive, Head of..., Chair/Chairman

10. Let me think about "___ green": PEA green, LAWN green... 

11. Words that go with "EXECUTIVE": DIRECTOR, CHIEF, CHAIR (executive chair?)

12. Quentin Tarantino movies: FICTION (Pulp Fiction), DOGS (Reservoir Dogs), UNCHAINED (Django Unchained), BROWN (Jackie Brown)!
    That's 4! FICTION, DOGS, UNCHAINED, BROWN

13. Shades of green: PEA, LAWN, FIELD... need more

14. ___ green or green ___: 
    - PEA green
    - LAWN (green lawn)
    - FIELD green?

Let me verify the Tarantino movies:
&bull; Pulp FICTION
&bull; Reservoir DOGS
&bull; Django UNCHAINED
&bull; Jackie BROWN

Yes! That seems like a strong category.

Other potential categories:
&bull; Leadership roles: DIRECTOR, CHIEF, HEAD, CHAIR (all can be leadership positions)
&bull; Shades of green or things that are green: PEA, LAWN, FIELD, maybe HAZEL?
&bull; Eye colors: HAZEL, GREEN, BROWN... but BROWN is likely Tarantino

Wait, if BROWN is for Tarantino, then eye colors would need another word.

Let me reconsider:
&bull; COCO could be COCO Chanel?
&bull; GROUNDS, FIELD, LAWN - outdoor areas?

Actually, looking at COCO, HAZEL, GREEN, PEA - could these be related to something?
&bull; COCO Chanel
&bull; HAZEL (name)
&bull; GREEN (name - like Eva Green?)

GROUNDS, HAZEL, GREEN, CHEST, COCO, FIELD, DIRECTOR, HEAD, LAWN, CHAIR, PEA, CHIEF

Let me analyze these remaining words:

1. Leadership/Executive positions: DIRECTOR, HEAD, CHAIR, CHIEF
   - Executive Director
   - Head (of department)
   - Chair (Chairman)
   - Chief (Chief Executive)
   These could all be leadership titles!

2. Shades of green: PEA (pea green), LAWN (lawn green?), FIELD (field green?)... 
   - Actually, maybe words that can precede "green": PEA green, LAWN green... hmm

3. Outdoor areas: GROUNDS, FIELD, LAWN - these are all outdoor grassy areas

4. COCO, HAZEL - these could be names
   - COCO Chanel
   - HAZEL (name)

5. Words that can follow "PLAYING": FIELD (playing field), CHEST? No...

6. Let me think about CHEST - treasure chest, chest of drawers, hope chest...

7. ___ NUT: HAZEL (hazelnut), COCO (coconut), CHEST (chestnut), PEA (peanut)!
   HAZEL, COCO, CHEST, PEA - all can precede "NUT"!
   - Hazelnut
   - Coconut
   - Chestnut
   - Peanut

That's a strong category! Let me go with that.

Actually wait, let me verify:
&bull; HAZEL + NUT = Hazelnut ✓
&bull; COCO + NUT = Coconut ✓
&bull; CHEST + NUT = Chestnut ✓
&bull; PEA + NUT = Peanut ✓

Yes, this is very strong!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

EEK, COUNTER, LOUNGE, HIVE, SWIPE, SCROLL, TAP, CHILL, VEG, BAR, ALE, QUASH, PINCH, TABLE, LOAF, BOOTH

Let me look for patterns:

1. Phone/touchscreen gestures: SWIPE, SCROLL, TAP, PINCH - these are all touchscreen gestures!

2. Places to sit/relax in a bar or restaurant: LOUNGE, BAR, BOOTH, COUNTER - these could all be seating areas

3. Words meaning to relax/do nothing: CHILL, VEG, LOAF - need a fourth... maybe LOUNGE? LOUNGE can mean to relax lazily

4. BEE-related words (words that can follow BEE or precede BEE):
&bull; HIVE (beehive)
&bull; QUASH could be part of something...
&bull; Wait, let me think about this differently

5. Words that can follow "BEE": 
&bull; HIVE (beehive)

6. Let me think about "____ house":
&bull; ALE house
&bull; TABLE... 

7. Types of gestures on phone: SWIPE, SCROLL, TAP, PINCH - this seems very strong

8. Words meaning to relax: CHILL, VEG, LOAF, LOUNGE - all can mean to be lazy/relax

9. Bar/restaurant seating: BOOTH, BAR, COUNTER, TABLE - places to sit

10. What about EEK, HIVE, ALE, QUASH?
&bull; EEK - exclamation
&bull; HIVE - bee home
&bull; ALE - beer
&bull; QUASH - to suppress

Let me think about word associations:
&bull; QUASH sounds like SQUASH
&bull; Could these be words that sound like vegetables when you add a letter?
&bull; EEK → LEEK (vegetable!)
&bull; ALE → KALE (vegetable!)
&bull; QUASH → SQUASH (vegetable!)
&bull; HIVE → CHIVE (vegetable!)

That's a clever pattern! EEK, ALE, QUASH, HIVE - all become vegetables when you add a letter at the beginning.

So my four groups might be:
1. Touchscreen gestures: SWIPE, SCROLL, TAP, PINCH
2. Relax/be lazy: CHILL, VEG, LOAF, LOUNGE
3. Bar/restaurant seating: BOOTH, BAR, COUNTER, TABLE
4. Add letter to get vegetable: EEK (leek), ALE (kale), QUASH (squash), HIVE (chive)

Let me verify:
&bull; Group 1: SWIPE, SCROLL, TAP, PINCH ✓ all phone gestures
&bull; Group 2: CHILL, VEG, LOAF, LOUNGE ✓ all mean relax
&bull; Group 3: BOOTH, BAR, COUNTER, TABLE ✓ all places in a bar/restaurant
&bull; Group 4: EEK→LEEK, ALE→KALE, QUASH→SQUASH, HIVE→CHIVE ✓

This accounts for all 16 words! I'm most confident about the touchscreen gestures, so I'll start there.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

EEK, COUNTER, LOUNGE, HIVE, CHILL, VEG, BAR, ALE, QUASH, TABLE, LOAF, BOOTH

My proposed remaining groups:

2. Bar/restaurant seating: BOOTH, BAR, COUNTER, TABLE - places to sit
3. Add letter to get vegetable: EEK (leek), ALE (kale), QUASH (squash), HIVE (chive)

&bull; ALE + K = KALE

Looking at the words:
SHAR PEI, SCATTER, SPRINKLE, LITTER, BRAIN, PEPPER, TOOTH, FLICK, PICTURE, SIXTEEN, TALK, PRUNE, FEATURE, CREPE PAPER, POTATO, FILM

Let me think about potential categories:

1. Words that can follow "SMALL" or precede something?
&bull; SMALL TALK, SMALL FRY...

2. Types of movies/films?
&bull; FLICK, PICTURE, FEATURE, FILM - these could all be synonyms for "movie"!

3. Things that are "THIN"?
&bull; THIN could go with: SHAR PEI (wrinkly dog, not thin), CREPE PAPER (thin), POTATO (thin chips?)...

4. Words related to spreading/distributing:
&bull; SCATTER, SPRINKLE, PEPPER, LITTER - these all mean to spread things around!

5. Things that can be "FAIRY"?
&bull; FAIRY TALE, FAIRY... hmm

6. "___ SKIN":
&bull; POTATO SKIN, BANANA... 

7. Words that go with a number/age:
&bull; SWEET SIXTEEN

8. Body parts that can be "FAIRY":
&bull; TOOTH FAIRY

9. Things with "WRINKLED" or similar?
&bull; SHAR PEI (wrinkly dog), PRUNE (wrinkled fruit), BRAIN (wrinkled), CREPE PAPER (wrinkled texture)!

Let me verify:
&bull; SHAR PEI - known for wrinkly skin
&bull; PRUNE - wrinkled dried fruit
&bull; BRAIN - has a wrinkled surface
&bull; CREPE PAPER - has a crinkled/wrinkled texture

This seems like a strong connection - things that are WRINKLED!

Let me also verify the movie synonyms:
&bull; FLICK - slang for movie
&bull; PICTURE - old term for movie
&bull; FEATURE - feature film
&bull; FILM - movie

And the "spread around" words:
&bull; SCATTER - spread around
&bull; SPRINKLE - spread around
&bull; PEPPER - to pepper with (spread)
&bull; LITTER - to scatter/spread trash

That leaves: BRAIN, TOOTH, SIXTEEN, TALK, POTATO
Wait, I already put BRAIN in the wrinkled category.

Let me reconsider. If wrinkled is: SHAR PEI, PRUNE, BRAIN, CREPE PAPER
Movies are: FLICK, PICTURE, FEATURE, FILM
Spread: SCATTER, SPRINKLE, PEPPER, LITTER

That leaves: TOOTH, SIXTEEN, TALK, POTATO

Could these go with "SWEET"?
&bull; SWEET TOOTH - yes!
&bull; SWEET SIXTEEN - yes!
&bull; SWEET TALK - yes!
&bull; SWEET POTATO - yes!

This is perfect! "SWEET ___" words!

1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

Available words: CHORAL, CALL, RAP, SPLIT, DIVINE, WIGHT, READ, SHADE, SPECTER, SPIRIT, BROKE, BLEW, BURST, FORECAST, JAZZ, AMERICANA

Let me look for patterns:

1. Ghost/supernatural related: SPECTER, SPIRIT, SHADE, WIGHT - these are all words for ghosts or supernatural beings

2. Music genres: JAZZ, RAP, CHORAL, AMERICANA - these could all be music genres/styles

3. Words that can follow "___" or precede "___":
&bull; SPLIT, BROKE, BURST, BLEW - could these all go with something? 
  - "SPLIT second", "BROKE", "BURST", "BLEW" - past tense verbs?
  - Actually: SPLIT, BROKE, BURST, BLEW could all be past tense of words meaning "to break/rupture"

4. DIVINE, FORECAST, READ, CALL - things you can do to predict/see the future?
&bull; DIVINE the future
&bull; FORECAST the future
&bull; READ (tea leaves, palms)
&bull; CALL (make a call/prediction)

Let me verify:
&bull; Ghost words: SPECTER, SPIRIT, SHADE, WIGHT - all ghosts ✓
&bull; Music: JAZZ, RAP, CHORAL, AMERICANA - genres ✓
&bull; Fortune telling: DIVINE, FORECAST, READ, CALL - ways to predict ✓
&bull; Past tense of "break": SPLIT, BROKE, BURST, BLEW - hmm, BLEW doesn't mean break

Wait, let me reconsider:
&bull; SPLIT, BROKE, BURST, BLEW - could these be slang for "left quickly"? "He split", "He blew out of there"

Or maybe: Things that can come before a common word?
&bull; ISLE OF WIGHT, SHADE, SPECTER, SPIRIT... 

Let me think about "___ of Man" or similar:
&bull; ISLE OF WIGHT (not quite)
&bull; ISLE OF MAN

Actually, thinking about "_____ END":
&bull; SPLIT END
&bull; DEAD END
&bull; No...

What about things that go with "OPEN"?
&bull; BURST OPEN
&bull; SPLIT OPEN
&bull; BROKE OPEN
&bull; BLEW OPEN - yes! All of these can precede OPEN!

So my groups:
1. Ghosts: SPECTER, SPIRIT, SHADE, WIGHT
2. Music genres: JAZZ, RAP, CHORAL, AMERICANA
3. Can precede OPEN: SPLIT, BROKE, BURST, BLEW
4. Fortune telling methods: DIVINE, FORECAST, READ, CALL

Let me start with what I'm most confident about - the ghost/supernatural words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: CALL, SPLIT, DIVINE, READ, BROKE, BLEW, BURST, FORECAST

That's 8 words for 2 groups.

My predicted groups:
1. Can precede OPEN: SPLIT, BROKE, BURST, BLEW

BLUSH, TRAIL, DYE, PACE, TIGER, RATE, STOCKINGS, SWEAT, CLIP, TOWEL, GRADE, MASCARA, NOSE, RANK, FIDGET, SCORE

Looking for categories:

1. Makeup items: BLUSH, MASCARA, DYE (hair dye?)... need a 4th. NOSE could be part of makeup application area?

2. Words that can follow "SWEAT": SWEAT PANTS, SWEAT SHIRT... hmm not seeing a pattern here.

3. Rankings/Ratings: RATE, GRADE, RANK, SCORE - these all relate to evaluating or ranking something!

4. Things that can follow a color word:
&bull; TIGER (paper tiger? tiger lily?)
&bull; Let me think differently...

5. Body movements that show nervousness: FIDGET, SWEAT, PACE... need a 4th

6. Things with "stuffer" - STOCKING STUFFER... hmm

7. Let me think about compound words or phrases:
&bull; PAPER ___: PAPER TIGER, PAPER CLIP, PAPER TOWEL, PAPER TRAIL! That's 4!
&bull; PAPER TIGER, PAPER CLIP, PAPER TOWEL, PAPER TRAIL

8. Rating words: RATE, GRADE, RANK, SCORE - all mean to evaluate

9. Signs of nervousness: SWEAT, FIDGET, PACE... BLUSH? That could work - you blush when nervous!

10. Makeup: BLUSH, MASCARA... DYE... what else?

Let me verify:
&bull; PAPER ___: TIGER, CLIP, TOWEL, TRAIL - yes, all make sense!
&bull; Rating/Ranking: RATE, GRADE, RANK, SCORE - yes!
&bull; Signs of nervousness: SWEAT, FIDGET, PACE, BLUSH - yes!
&bull; Remaining: DYE, STOCKINGS, MASCARA, NOSE

What connects DYE, STOCKINGS, MASCARA, NOSE?
&bull; These could all follow a word... RUN? 
&bull; NOSE RUN (runny nose), MASCARA RUN, STOCKINGS RUN, DYE RUN?
&bull; Actually: RUN in your STOCKINGS, RUN in MASCARA (when it runs), NOSE RUNS, DYE RUNS
&bull; Or ___ RUN: NOSE RUN (not quite), but these things can "run"

Let me think again - things that can RUN:
&bull; STOCKINGS run
&bull; MASCARA runs
&bull; DYE runs
&bull; NOSE runs

Yes! These are all things that can "run" in the sense of spreading/leaking!

So my four categories:
1. PAPER ___: TIGER, CLIP, TOWEL, TRAIL
2. Rating words: RATE, GRADE, RANK, SCORE
3. Signs of nervousness: SWEAT, FIDGET, PACE, BLUSH
4. Things that run: DYE, STOCKINGS, MASCARA, NOSE

Now let me verify my other hypotheses:

1. Rating/Ranking words: RATE, GRADE, RANK, SCORE - all mean to evaluate/rank something. Very confident in this.

2. Signs of nervousness: SWEAT, FIDGET, PACE, BLUSH - you sweat when nervous, fidget when nervous, pace when nervous, blush when nervous. This seems solid.

3. Things that can "run": DYE, STOCKINGS, MASCARA, NOSE - dye runs, stockings run, mascara runs, nose runs. This also seems solid.

FOLLOW, MONITOR, PRINTER, ROGER, DONUT, TRIX, JUROR, VELVETEEN, TRACK, MONTH, PEN, SQUID, WHITE, TATTOO MACHINE, ROSE, WATCH

Let me look for patterns:

1. Words that can follow "RABBIT":
&bull; ROGER (Roger Rabbit)
&bull; VELVETEEN (Velveteen Rabbit)
&bull; WHITE (White Rabbit - Alice in Wonderland)
&bull; TRIX (Trix rabbit - "Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids")
&bull; DONUT (? not sure)
&bull; JUROR (? not sure)

2. Things that use ink:
&bull; PRINTER
&bull; PEN
&bull; TATTOO MACHINE
&bull; SQUID (squids produce ink)

3. Words meaning to observe/keep track of:
&bull; FOLLOW
&bull; MONITOR
&bull; TRACK
&bull; WATCH

4. Looking at remaining words: ROGER, DONUT, TRIX, JUROR, VELVETEEN, MONTH, WHITE, ROSE

Wait, let me reconsider "___ RABBIT":
&bull; ROGER Rabbit
&bull; VELVETEEN Rabbit
&bull; WHITE Rabbit
&bull; Could JUROR work? No...
&bull; TRIX rabbit (the cereal mascot)

Actually, let me think about things that produce/use INK:
&bull; PRINTER (uses ink)
&bull; PEN (uses ink)
&bull; TATTOO MACHINE (uses ink)
&bull; SQUID (produces ink)

This seems like a strong group!

Words meaning to observe/follow:
&bull; FOLLOW
&bull; MONITOR
&bull; TRACK
&bull; WATCH

This also seems strong!

For "___ RABBIT":
&bull; ROGER
&bull; VELVETEEN
&bull; WHITE
&bull; Need one more... JACK? No, that's not here.

What about things with holes:
&bull; DONUT (has a hole)
&bull; Could work with others?

Let me think about MONTH, ROSE...

Could these go with a word? Like "of the ___":
&bull; MONTH (of the month)
&bull; ROSE (? Rose of...)

Or "___ by any other name":
&bull; ROSE

Let me think about "12" or numbers:
&bull; JUROR (12 jurors)
&bull; MONTH (12 months)
&bull; ROSE (? dozen roses?)
&bull; DONUT (dozen donuts?)

Hmm, things that come in 12s:
&bull; JUROR (12 in a jury)
&bull; MONTH (12 in a year)
&bull; DONUT (often sold by dozen)
&bull; ROSE (dozen roses)

That could work!

So my groups might be:
1. INK things: PRINTER, PEN, TATTOO MACHINE, SQUID
2. Observe/track: FOLLOW, MONITOR, TRACK, WATCH
3. Come in 12s: JUROR, MONTH, DONUT, ROSE
4. ___ RABBIT: ROGER, VELVETEEN, WHITE, TRIX

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

Looking at the words: DAY, GENESIS, BIRTH, WED, COMBINE, DAWN, START, NES, FUSE, POLE, MTV, VHS, BOND, FLY, ALF, FLOWER

Possible groupings:

1. Things that can follow "BEGINNING" or mean "beginning": GENESIS, BIRTH, DAWN, START - these all relate to beginnings/origins

2. 1980s things/technology: NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), MTV, VHS, ALF (TV show) - all from the 1980s

3. Words that can follow "MAY": DAY (Mayday), POLE (Maypole), FLOWER (Mayflower), FLY (Mayfly) - this seems strong!

4. Words related to joining/combining: WED, COMBINE, FUSE, BOND - all mean to join together

Let me verify:
&bull; MAY___: Mayday, Maypole, Mayflower, Mayfly - YES, all work!
&bull; 80s nostalgia: NES, MTV, VHS, ALF - all emerged in the 1980s
&bull; Beginning synonyms: GENESIS, BIRTH, DAWN, START - all mean beginning
&bull; Joining words: WED, COMBINE, FUSE, BOND - all mean to unite/join

Wait, let me reconsider. GENESIS could also be the Sega Genesis console, which would fit with NES, VHS, MTV... but Sega Genesis was late 80s/early 90s.

Actually, looking more carefully:
&bull; SEGA GENESIS - video game console
&bull; NES - Nintendo Entertainment System
&bull; MTV - Music Television
&bull; VHS - Video format
&bull; ALF - TV show

These could all be 80s entertainment/technology. But that's 5 items if I include GENESIS.

Let me stick with my analysis:
&bull; MAY + word: DAY, POLE, FLOWER, FLY (most confident)
&bull; 80s tech/entertainment: NES, MTV, VHS, ALF
&bull; Beginning synonyms: GENESIS, BIRTH, DAWN, START
&bull; Joining/uniting: WED, COMBINE, FUSE, BOND

I'll start with the MAY words as it seems most concrete.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now let me verify my other hypotheses:

1. 80s tech/entertainment: NES, MTV, VHS, ALF - all from the 1980s
   - NES (Nintendo Entertainment System - 1985)
   - MTV (1981)
   - VHS (became popular in 80s)
   - ALF (TV show 1986-1990)

2. Beginning synonyms: GENESIS, BIRTH, DAWN, START - all mean beginning/origin

3. Joining/uniting words: WED, COMBINE, FUSE, BOND - all mean to join together

Wait, I should reconsider if there could be other patterns. Let me think about:
&bull; BOND could be James Bond
&bull; GENESIS could be Sega Genesis or the band Genesis
&bull; FUSE could be a TV channel

Actually, what about things that can come before a common word?
&bull; JAMES BOND, SAVINGS BOND...
&bull; WED could be part of something else

Let me think about TV channels: MTV, VHS (not a channel), FUSE (yes, a TV channel)...

Hmm, let me stick with my analysis. The 80s group seems strong.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

My hypotheses:

2. Joining/uniting words: WED, COMBINE, FUSE, BOND - all mean to join together

Both of these seem very solid. Let me go with the beginning synonyms first.

GENESIS - the beginning, origin
BIRTH - the start of life, beginning
DAWN - the start of a day, beginning of something
START - beginning

Yes, these all mean "beginning" or "origin."</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

1. Male animals:
&bull; BUCK (male deer)
&bull; STAG (male deer)
&bull; BILLY (male goat)
&bull; RAM (male sheep)
&bull; JACK (male donkey)
That's 5 words, so need to narrow down.

2. Words meaning "alone/single":
&bull; SOLO
&bull; SINGLE
&bull; FREE (as in free agent?)
&bull; Hmm, not quite 4

3. Chinese dynasties:
&bull; MING (dynasty)
&bull; HAN (dynasty)
&bull; TANG (dynasty)

That's exactly 4! This seems strong.

4. Words meaning "energy/zest":
&bull; ZEST
&bull; ZING
&bull; PUNCH
&bull; KICK
All can mean having energy or flavor punch. That's exactly 4!

5. Looking at what's left after dynasties and energy words:
JACK, BUCK, FREE, STAG, BILLY, SOLO, SINGLE, RAM

Male animals from this: BUCK, STAG, BILLY, RAM, JACK
That's 5, but JACK could be something else (like blackjack, or jack as in money)

6. Could FREE, SOLO, SINGLE have a connection?
&bull; FREE could relate to "for free"
&bull; SOLO could be Han Solo (Star Wars)
&bull; Wait, HAN Solo! But HAN is in dynasties...

7. Looking at BUCK, FREE, SINGLE:
&bull; BUCK can mean a dollar
&bull; Could these relate to money or currency?

8. Actually, let me reconsider:
&bull; FREE, SOLO, SINGLE, STAG could all describe being alone/unmarried
&bull; STAG party (bachelor party), going solo, single, free (unattached)

Let me start with the strongest connection - Chinese dynasties:
MING, HAN, TANG, SONG - all Chinese dynasties</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

&bull; ZING
&bull; PUNCH

All can describe having a strong flavor or energy. This seems like a solid group of 4.

3. Words meaning "alone/unattached":
&bull; SOLO
&bull; SINGLE
&bull; FREE
&bull; STAG (as in "stag party" or going stag)

Wait, STAG could fit in both "male animals" and "alone/unattached" categories.

If STAG goes with SOLO, SINGLE, FREE (meaning alone/unattached), then:
Male animals would be: BUCK, BILLY, RAM, JACK - exactly 4!

Some observations:
1. PROGRESSIVE, LEFT, LIBERAL - these are all political terms for left-leaning views
2. DEPARTED, MARTIAN, GOOD SHEPHERD, RAINMAKER - these could be Matt Damon movies ("The Departed", "The Martian", "The Good Shepherd", "The Rainmaker")
3. CONE, CUP, SHAKE - these could be ice cream related items
4. SPLIT - could be ice cream (banana split) or political/other

&bull; The Departed (2006)
&bull; The Martian (2015)
&bull; The Good Shepherd (2006)
&bull; The Rainmaker (1997)
Yes! These are all Matt Damon films.

Now for political terms meaning "left-leaning":
&bull; PROGRESSIVE
&bull; LEFT
&bull; LIBERAL
&bull; BLUE (as in "blue states")
That's 4!

Ice cream related:
&bull; CONE
&bull; CUP
&bull; SHAKE
&bull; SPLIT (banana split)
That's 4!

What's left? THEATER, SPACECRAFT, FICTIONAL BOXER, GREEK/ROMAN GOD
These seem like they could go with something... Maybe they all can follow a word like "SPACE"?
&bull; SPACE THEATER? Not common
&bull; SPACECRAFT - yes
&bull; Wait, these might be things that can follow "APOLLO":
&bull; APOLLO THEATER
&bull; APOLLO SPACECRAFT
&bull; APOLLO CREED (FICTIONAL BOXER from Rocky)
&bull; APOLLO (GREEK/ROMAN GOD)
Yes! These all follow "APOLLO"!

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

Looking at the words: PORTAL, DOOR, FLEET, COMPASS, HATCH, SCALE, WALL, BETTER, DOWNING, KEY, MAIN, GATE, BEST, TOP, INSET, BEAT

First, I notice some words that could be entrances/openings:
&bull; PORTAL, DOOR, HATCH, GATE - these are all ways to enter/exit

Let me check for other patterns:

Famous streets:
&bull; WALL (Wall Street)
&bull; FLEET (Fleet Street)
&bull; DOWNING (Downing Street)
&bull; MAIN (Main Street)
&bull; KEY (Key... not sure)

Wait, let me think about "___ Street":
&bull; WALL Street
&bull; FLEET Street
&bull; DOWNING Street
&bull; MAIN Street

That's 4! This seems like a strong connection.

Words that can follow "MAP":
&bull; SCALE (map scale)
&bull; KEY (map key)
&bull; COMPASS (map compass? or just compass)
&bull; INSET (map inset)

This could be another group - things found on a map!

Words meaning "to surpass/defeat":
&bull; BETTER (to better someone)
&bull; BEST (to best someone)
&bull; TOP (to top someone)
&bull; BEAT (to beat someone)

These all mean to defeat or surpass!

That leaves: PORTAL, DOOR, HATCH, GATE
These are all entrances/openings - ways to go through something.

Let me verify my groups:
1. ___ Street: WALL, FLEET, DOWNING, MAIN
2. Map elements: SCALE, KEY, COMPASS, INSET
3. To surpass/defeat: BETTER, BEST, TOP, BEAT
4. Entrances: PORTAL, DOOR, HATCH, GATE

Wait, but KEY could be in multiple categories (map key, or Key Street?). Let me reconsider.

Actually, I'm confident about the "___ Street" group and the "surpass/defeat" group. Let me start with the surpass/defeat group as it seems very clear.

BETTER, BEST, TOP, BEAT - all verbs meaning to defeat or surpass someone.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

1. ___ Street: WALL, FLEET, DOWNING, MAIN - this still looks strong
2. Map elements: SCALE, KEY, COMPASS, INSET - things found on a map
3. Entrances: PORTAL, DOOR, HATCH, GATE - ways to go through something

Let me verify the "___ Street" group:
&bull; WALL Street (famous NYC financial district)
&bull; FLEET Street (famous London street for newspapers)
&bull; DOWNING Street (famous London street, #10 Downing Street)
&bull; MAIN Street (common street name, also concept of "Main Street America")

Looking at the words:
HAMMER, PITCHFORK, TAIL, HOGWASH, HITCH, HORSEFEATHERS, CROCK, GOATEE, HORNS, POLE, BEND, HURDLE, BOWLINE, SHEEPSHANK, BATON, BUNK

Let me look for patterns:

1. Knots: BOWLINE, SHEEPSHANK, HITCH, BEND - these are all types of knots! That's a strong connection.

2. Nonsense/Baloney words: HOGWASH, HORSEFEATHERS, CROCK, BUNK - these all mean "nonsense" or "rubbish"

3. Relay race elements: BATON, HURDLE... what else? POLE (pole vault is different though)

4. Things a devil has: HORNS, TAIL, PITCHFORK... what's the fourth?

5. Parts of body/face: GOATEE (beard style), HORNS, TAIL

Let me reconsider:
&bull; HAMMER could be part of "throw" events in track and field: HAMMER throw
&bull; POLE could be pole vault
&bull; HURDLE is track
&bull; BATON is relay

Track and field events: HAMMER (throw), POLE (vault), HURDLE, BATON (relay)? But these aren't quite the same category.

Devil imagery: HORNS, TAIL, PITCHFORK... and maybe GOATEE (devils are often depicted with goatees)? That could work!

Let me verify my strongest guesses:

1. Knots: BOWLINE, SHEEPSHANK, HITCH, BEND - Very confident
2. Nonsense words: HOGWASH, HORSEFEATHERS, CROCK, BUNK - Very confident
3. Devil features: HORNS, TAIL, PITCHFORK, GOATEE - Fairly confident

My two remaining hypotheses:

2. Track and field: HAMMER (throw), POLE (vault), HURDLE, BATON (relay) - all related to track and field events.

Let me identify potential categories:

1. Disney Princesses: MERIDA (Brave), AURORA (Sleeping Beauty), TIANA (Princess and the Frog), ARIEL (Little Mermaid) - that's 4!

2. Fonts: VERDANA, IMPACT, GEORGIA, ARIAL - these are all computer fonts!

3. Gymnastics moves: ARABESQUE, SPLIT, ROUNDOFF - these could be gymnastics terms. Need a 4th... 

4. Words ending in "-AL" or types of measurements/analysis:
AREAL, ANGULAR, AERIAL, LINEAR, VOLUMETRIC - these could relate to types of measurements or analysis

Wait, let me reconsider:
&bull; AREAL (relating to area)
&bull; ANGULAR (relating to angles)
&bull; AERIAL (relating to air/from above)
&bull; LINEAR (relating to lines)
&bull; VOLUMETRIC (relating to volume)

These could be types of measurements or "___ analysis" or similar.

Let me think about gymnastics moves again:
&bull; ARABESQUE (a position)
&bull; SPLIT (a position/move)
&bull; ROUNDOFF (a tumbling move)
&bull; AERIAL (a move without hands touching the ground!)

So AERIAL could be a gymnastics move! That would give us 4 gymnastics terms.

Let me verify my categories:
1. Disney Princesses: MERIDA, AURORA, TIANA, ARIEL
2. Computer Fonts: VERDANA, IMPACT, GEORGIA, ARIAL
3. Gymnastics moves: ARABESQUE, SPLIT, ROUNDOFF, AERIAL

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Provide your response in this exact structure:

SPARK, FIREWORKS, BANSHEE, WOOD, WAILER, CARPET, SHORE, COAST, LAMINATE, HEARTBREAKER, PIP, BANK, CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, STRAND, TILE

Let me look for patterns:

1. Types of flooring: WOOD, CARPET, LAMINATE, TILE - these are all flooring types!

2. Beach/water related: SHORE, COAST, BANK, STRAND - these could all be words for the edge of water/beach

3. Music artists named "The ___": 
&bull; BANSHEE (Siouxsie and the Banshees)
&bull; WAILER (Bob Marley and the Wailers)
&bull; HEARTBREAKER (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers)
&bull; PIP (Gladys Knight and the Pips)

4. That leaves: SPARK, FIREWORKS, CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION
These could all be words describing romantic attraction or interpersonal chemistry! "There's a spark between them", "fireworks", "chemistry", "connection"

Let me verify:
&bull; Flooring: WOOD, CARPET, LAMINATE, TILE ✓
&bull; Edge of water: SHORE, COAST, BANK, STRAND ✓
&bull; "___ and the ___s" bands: BANSHEE, WAILER, HEARTBREAKER, PIP ✓
&bull; Romantic attraction words: SPARK, FIREWORKS, CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION ✓

I'm most confident about the flooring category, so I'll start there.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Looking at the words:
BLANKET, DRAW, PLAY, SHAM, HONOR, PASS, STATE, THROW, UPHOLD, DISCARD, JUSTICE, LABOR, FULFILL, ENERGY, SHEET, KEEP

Possible categories I see:

1. Bedding items: BLANKET, SHAM, THROW, SHEET - these are all things you'd find on a bed

2. Card game actions: DRAW, PLAY, PASS, DISCARD - these are all things you do in card games

3. ___ DEPARTMENT (US Government departments): STATE, JUSTICE, LABOR, ENERGY - these are all U.S. Cabinet departments

4. Words that go with "promise" or related to keeping promises: HONOR (honor a promise), KEEP (keep a promise), UPHOLD (uphold a promise), FULFILL (fulfill a promise) - these all mean to maintain/complete a commitment

Let me verify:
&bull; Bedding: BLANKET, SHAM, THROW, SHEET ✓
&bull; Card game actions: DRAW, PLAY, PASS, DISCARD ✓
&bull; US Departments: STATE, JUSTICE, LABOR, ENERGY ✓
&bull; Keep a promise synonyms: HONOR, KEEP, UPHOLD, FULFILL ✓
