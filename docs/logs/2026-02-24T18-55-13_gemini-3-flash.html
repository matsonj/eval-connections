1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Provide your response in this exact structure:

&lt;thinking&gt;
[Your reasoning]

&lt;guess&gt;
[EXACTLY four words, ALL CAPS, comma-separated]
&lt;/guess&gt;

Let's look at other clusters.

Group 1: Synonyms for "prepared and willing"
WILLING, EAGER, READY, ABLE (GAME and PREPARE also fit, but these four are a classic set).

Group 2: Government Agencies / Organizations
NASA, NOAA, N.F.L.

Group 3: Words associated with a house/structure
EAVE, CANE (maybe?), DOWN (maybe?). This doesn't look right.

Group 4: Words that could mean "to provide with gear"
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE.

Let's look at the agencies again: NASA, NOAA, N.F.L. Is there a fourth? SUBARU and PARAMOUNT are companies. 

Wait, let's look at words that can be followed by "STAIRS": DOWN... no.
Let's look at words associated with "OFF": CANE (no), GAME (no).

How about words meaning "prepared/ready":
READY, ABLE, WILLING, GAME.

How about synonyms for "provide with gear":
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE... and what else?

How about words associated with "stars":
PARAMOUNT (logo), SUBARU (logo), NASA (space), NFL (stars?). That's a stretch.

My previous guess had GAME instead of EAGER. If that was "ONE AWAY", the swap to EAGER is logical.

However, let's look at another group:
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY. All mean "to get ready".

What about the others?
NASA, NOAA, N.F.L., SUBARU, PARAMOUNT, ABLE, CANE, DOWN, EAVE, EAGER, GAME, WILLING.

Wait:
NASA logo: Stars
SUBARU logo: Stars (Pleiades)
PARAMOUNT logo: Stars
N.F.L. logo: Stars

That looks like a solid category (Logos with stars).

Synonyms for "Ready to do something":
WILLING, EAGER, GAME, ABLE?

Let's verify the other groups:
Group: "To provide with gear"
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY.

Group: "Willingness"
EAGER, WILLING, GAME, ABLE.

Remaining: CANE, DOWN, EAVE, NOAA.

Wait!
Sugar ____: CANE, DOWN (no), BOWL (no).

Let's rethink:
CANE, DOWN, EAVE, ABLE.
If I put "HURRI" in front:
HURRICANE
HURRIDOWN (no)

Wait: "WE" sounds:
Willing / Eager ... No.

Let's look at synonyms for "To prepare/equip":
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY.

Let's look at "Words after 'READY'":

Let's try "Willingness" again:
WILLING, EAGER, GAME, READY. (If this is 1 away, maybe ABLE is in there).

Wait: EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY. These are definitely "To get ready".

What about the "E" words?
EAVE, EAGER, EQUIP.

How about "Words that have a double letter"?
WILLING, NOAA (no), OUTFIT (no).

Let's try:

Let's try the "synonyms for prepare" group.
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY.
If I am correct, then ABLE, EAGER, GAME, WILLING must be the other group.
And then CANE, DOWN, EAVE, NOAA must be the fourth.

Let's list them:
WILLING, EAGER, GAME, ABLE, READY, PREPARE, EQUIP, OUTFIT.

If WILLING, EAGER, GAME, ABLE was one away, then:
Maybe READY belongs here instead of ABLE or GAME?

Let's look at the remaining words:
CANE, DOWN, EAVE, NOAA. (This seems like a strong "category" if I can find the link).
Wait: "LEAVENED" (no).
"HURRICANE"
"HURRIDOWN" (no)
"HURRI...?"

Wait!
"DOWN", "EAVE", "ABLE".
If I add "L" to them:
L-DOWN (no)
L-EAVE (Leave)
L-ABLE (Lable? No)
L-CANE (No)

Wait!
What if they are "Words that sound like names of letters"?
ABLE (A)
CANE (K)
EAVE (E) - No, that's EVE.
NOAA (N) - No, that's EN.
OUTFIT (no).

Wait:
A (ABLE)
G (GAME)? No.
N (NOAA)? No.
K (CANE)
E (EAVE)
I (??)
Wait: "Able" sounds like "A", "Cane" sounds like "K".
Actually, let's look at syllables.

Let's try:
Group A: "Provide with equipment"
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY.

Group B: "Game", "Willing", "Eager", "Able". (One away??).
Wait, if READY was in Group B, and ABLE was in Group A?
Or if READY was in Group B, and GAME was in Group A?

Let's look at: CANE, DOWN, EAVE, NOAA again.
Wait!
"CANE", "EAVE", "ABLE", "WILLING".
Actually... "Names of trees"?
CANE (no), EAVE (no).

Wait:
"DOWN", "EAVE", "NOAA", "ABLE".
Wait... "NOAA"... "NOAH"...
"EAVE"... "EVE"...
"CANE"... "CAIN"...
"ABLE"... "ABEL"...
THEY ARE BIBLICAL NAMES!
CAIN, ABEL, EVE, NOAH.

Let's check the spellings:
CANE (Cain)
ABLE (Abel)
EAVE (Eve)
NOAA (Noah)

This is definitely a category!

Category: Homophones of Biblical names.
CANE (Cain), ABLE (Abel), EAVE (Eve), NOAA (Noah).

Remaining:
Group 1: WILLING, EAGER, GAME, READY. ("Willing to do").
Group 2: EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, DOWN? No.
Wait: EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE... and what?
Is there a fourth word for "Equip"?
Maybe "DOWN"? As in "Get down to business"? No.

Wait:
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE... and CANE? No.
OUTFIT, EQUIP, PREPARE...
Wait, what is "DOWN"?
"Duck down", "Eider down", "Goose down", "Swan down".
Wait, synonyms for "Feathers/Fluff":
DOWN. what else?

Let's look at the synonyms for "Inclined" again:
WILLING, EAGER, GAME, READY. (I'll try this).
Wait, no. If I use WILLING, EAGER, GAME, READY, the remaining words are:
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, DOWN.
Is DOWN a synonym for EQUIP/OUTFIT?
"Suit up", "Kit out"? No.

Wait! "KITTED UP"?
OUTFIT, EQUIP, PREPARE, ...
Wait, "DOWN"...
"TO GEAR DOWN?" No.

Wait! "GEAR" synonyms:
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, ...
Is it "GAME"? (No).

Wait! "READY", "EAGER", "WILLING", "GAME".
Let's try that again.
Wait, I tried READY, ABLE, WILLING, GAME and it was INCORRECT (no "one away" mentioned?).
Wait, the first guess was:
READY, ABLE, WILLING, GAME -&gt; "INCORRECT" (no note about "one away").
The second guess was:
NASA, NOAA, PARAMOUNT, SUBARU -&gt; "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY".
The third guess was:
NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, SUBARU -&gt; "CORRECT".

Okay, so the "one away" in guess 2 was NOAA/N.F.L.

Now, let's look at the remaining words:
CANE, WILLING, EQUIP, PREPARE, GAME, NOAA, DOWN, EAVE, EAGER, READY, ABLE, OUTFIT.

Biblical Homophones:
CANE (Cain), ABLE (Abel), EAVE (Eve), NOAA (Noah).
This is very likely.

Remaining:
WILLING, EAGER, GAME, READY.
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, DOWN.

Wait, the "Inclined" group:
WILLING, EAGER, GAME, READY. (All mean they are up for it).
The "Provide" group:
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, ... DOWN?

Wait, what about "DOWN"?
"Duck DOWN", "Eider DOWN"...
What about the others?
"OUTFIT", "EQUIP", "PREPARE"?

Wait! "DRESS" synonyms:
OUTFIT, EQUIP, PREPARE, ...
Wait, is "DOWN" something else?
Ooh!
"GET DOWN" (meaning prepare/ready?) No.

Wait: "READY" can be a synonym for "PREPARE".
What if the "Prepare/Equip" group is:
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY.
And the "Inclined" group is:
WILLING, EAGER, GAME, ... DOWN? (No).

Wait!
"GAME", "EAGER", "WILLING"... and...
Is it "DOWN"?
"I'm down for that" = "I'm game for that"!!
YES!
"DOWN", "GAME", "EAGER", "WILLING" all mean "interested/inclined to participate".

Let's check the remaining 4:
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY.
They all mean "to facilitate/get ready".

So the three categories are:
1. Biblical Homophones: CANE, ABLE, EAVE, NOAA.
2. "Inclined/Interested": WILLING, EAGER, GAME, DOWN.
3. "To get ready/equipment": EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY. (Wait, let me double check "EAGER").

Wait, EAGER and WILLING and GAME and DOWN all mean "Inclined".
Let's check: "I am down", "I am game", "I am willing", "I am... ready"? (No, eager).

Wait, let's look at the words again.
READY and PREPARE and EQUIP and OUTFIT. (Wait, is PREPARE and OUTFIT synonyms?)
Yes: "To outfit a ship", "To equip a ship", "To prepare a ship", "To ready a ship".

Okay, let's check the Biblical names again.
CANE (Cain), ABLE (Abel), EAVE (Eve), NOAA (Noah).

Let's try the "Gung-ho" group:
DOWN, GAME, WILLING, EAGER. (Wait, let me check the synonyms again).
WILLING, GAME, EAGER, ... ABLE? No, Abel is biblical.
WILLING, GAME, EAGER, DOWN.
"I'm down", "I'm game", "I'm willing", "I'm eager".
Yes.

Then the last category (Ready):
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY.

Wait, let me re-verify Category 1: NASA, NFL, PARAMOUNT, SUBARU (Stars in logo). (Already guessed correctly).

Category 2: CANE, ABLE, EAVE, NOAA (Biblical homophones).
Category 3: DOWN, GAME, WILLING, EAGER (Inclined).
Category 4: EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY (Get set).

Wait, "READY" can also mean "WILLING".
In my very first guess (READY, ABLE, WILLING, GAME), I got "INCORRECT" (no 'one away').
If it was NOT "one away", then at least TWO of those words were wrong.
ABLE and CANE (for example) were biblical names.
So if ABLE and CANE are Biblical, then the "inclined" group cannot have ABLE.
So the "inclined" group must have GAME and WILLING.
If it also has DOWN and EAGER? Let's check.
GAME, WILLING, DOWN, EAGER. (4 words).

What are the remaining?
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY. (4 words).
This works.

Let's check the first guess again: READY, ABLE, WILLING, GAME.
If Category A: ABLE, CANE, EAVE, NOAA.
Category B: DOWN, GAME, WILLING, EAGER.
Category C: EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY.

In my first guess (READY, ABLE, WILLING, GAME):
READY is from Category C.
ABLE is from Category A.
WILLING is from Category B.
GAME is from Category B.
This means there were 2 from Category B, 1 from A, and 1 from C.
That explains why it was "INCORRECT" with no "one away" (needs 3 to be "one away").

This fits perfectly!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Category 2: Synonyms for "To prepare/Equip"
EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, READY. ("To outfit a ship", "To ready the troops").

Let's double-check the "one away" logic for these:
If the first guess (READY, ABLE, WILLING, GAME) was just "INCORRECT", it had at most 2 words from any category.
My current categorization:
READY (Cat 2)
ABLE (Biblical - solved)
WILLING (Cat 1)

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

Let's test the male animals first, as it seems very cohesive:

If I replace one of the previous four with JACK, it might work.
However, I also noticed Chinese Dynasties: HAN, MING, SONG, TANG.

Wait, if HAN, MING, SONG, and TANG are the dynasties, then TANG is not in the "Energy" group.
Energy/Flavor: ZING, ZEST, KICK, PUNCH.

If Energy/Flavor is ZING, ZEST, KICK, PUNCH, then TANG must be a Dynasty.
Dynasties: HAN, MING, SONG, TANG.

That leaves: BILLY, BUCK, RAM, STAG, JACK, SINGLE, SOLO, FREE.

Wait, if STAG, BUCK, RAM, BILLY was one away, and JACK is also a male animal, then one of those four must belong elsewhere.
STAG, SINGLE, SOLO... these often mean "alone". Is there a fourth?

Potential connections:
1. WOODY, GUTHRIE, WOODSTOCK: Related to folk music / Woody Guthrie (who performed, and his son Arlo performed at Woodstock '69).
2. FOGHORN, WOODY: Cartoon characters (Foghorn Leghorn, Woody Woodpecker).
3. "___ LEGHORN": FOGHORN, CLASSICS (No), SCROOGE (No).
4. Names associated with "Woody": WOODY Guthrie, WOODY Woodpecker, WOODY Allen, WOODY (Toy Story).

Let's look at the remaining words: CLASSICS, FOGHORN, WOODY, CREATE, THEREFORE, WOODSTOCK, GUTHRIE, SCROOGE.

Wait, I see another pattern:
"A Christmas Carol" / Scrooge: SCROOGE.
Wait, "Illustrated ___": CLASSICS.
FOGHORN, WOODY, SCROOGE, WOODSTOCK are all characters?
&bull; FOGHORN Leghorn (Looney Tunes)
&bull; WOODY Woodpecker (or Toy Story)
&bull; WOODSTOCK (Peanuts)
&bull; SCROOGE (Disney/DuckTales or Dickens)

Actually, look at: GUTHRIE, WOODSTOCK, CREATE, THEREFORE, CLASSICS. No.

Let's look at "WOOD-":
WOODSTOCK, WOODY.

Wait! I see "___ COLLINS":
FOGHORN (No).

Let's try a different angle:
GUTHRIE (Theatric company/Building), CLASSICS, CREATE, THEREFORE.
These are types of departments? No.

Let's look at the words again:
CLASSICS, THEREFORE, CREATE, GUTHRIE.
Are these related to a University or Foundation?
Or are they:
GUTHRIE, FOGHORN, SCROOGE, WOODY? (Grumpy/Noisy characters?)

Wait:
"Great ____":
GUTHRIE (No)
"___ of the ____":

What about "Writers/Thinkers"?
No.

Let's look at:
FOGHORN, WOODSTOCK, WOODY, SCROOGE.

Checking for a connection:

Wait, let's look at the words again: CLASSICS, CREATE, THEREFORE, GUTHRIE.
Are they related to "I think, therefore I am" (Descartes)? No.

Let's look for "Radio" or "Theater" or "Publishing" connections.
Wait! 
&bull; CREATIVE (No, it's CREATE)
&bull; CLASSICS
&bull; GUTHRIE
&bull; THEREFORE

Wait, check the spellings/hidden words:
THEREFORE (contains REFORE?)

No.

Let's look at the category for the remaining words.
CLASSICS, CREATE, THEREFORE, GUTHRIE.
Are they names of cities? No.

Wait, are they "C-" words? No.
Let's try to find a word that precedes them.
&bull; "Radio ___": GUTHRIE (No)

Let's look at the words again. Is it possible there is a misspelling or a very specific niche?
GUTHRIE, CLASSICS, CREATE, THEREFORE.
Wait!
"Great ____"
&bull; Great CLASSICS
&bull; Great CREATE (No)
&bull; Great GUTHRIE (No)

"___ center":
&bull; GUTHRIE Center
&bull; CREATE Center (No)

Let's try another approach. Are they related to "AS IS"?
No.

What about "Commonly misspelled words"?
&bull; THEREFORE (usually fine)
&bull; GUTHRIE (often misspelled)

Actually, let's look at the remaining words one more time:
CLASSICS, CREATE, THEREFORE, GUTHRIE.
Could they be related to "Radio"? No.
Could they be related to "Work"? No.

Wait! I see it:
"___ AND ___"
"___ OR ___"

Wait, I have a different idea. 
Is it "___-FOR"?
CREATE-for (No)
THERE-for (THEREFORE)
CLASSICS-for (No)

Wait! 
Let's look for "___-E". 
GUTHRIE
CREATE
THEREFORE
(Classic is usually with an S).

Wait, I think I found a lead:
They are all names of Departments/Schools at a specific University? 
Or maybe labels?

Let's look at the words very carefully:
GUTHRIE
CLASSICS
CREATE
THEREFORE

Is it "Words containing a conjunction"?
THERE(FOR)E
(Wait, that's not right).

What if it's "___-S"?
CLASSICS
GUTHRIES (No)

Actually, look at:
GUTHRIE
THEREFORE
CREATE
CLASSICS

G-U-T-H-R-I-E
T-H-E-R-E-F-O-R-E

They all contain "REAL"? No.
They all contain "EAT"?
GUTHRIE (No)
THEREFORE (No)
CREATE (Yes)
CLASSICS (No)

Wait!
"___ OF THE ___"
"___ TO ___"

Let's just group them, as they are the only ones left.
The connection might be "Ending in a specific sound" or "Names of X".
Actually, GUTHRIE, CLASSICS, CREATE, THEREFORE.
Could it be "___ Station"? (Guthrie Station, No).

Actually, let's look at the first two letters:
CL, CR, TH, GU.

Wait, I see "TH", "R", "E" in all of them? No.
I will guess these four as they are the only remaining words.
The category is likely something like "Words with three vowels" or "Famous theater names" or something subtle.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

As identified in the previous step, I see a clear category for smartphone/touchpad gestures:
PINCH, SCROLL, SWIPE, TAP.

The four remaining words after that would be: HIVE, EEK, QUASH, ALE.
Checking if they share a connection:
&bull; BEEHIVE/BEEK
&bull; SQUEAK/SQUASH/SQUALE? No.
Wait, let's look at the remaining four differently:
EEK, QUASH, ALE, HIVE.
If I add "S" to the front: SEEK, SQUASH, SALE, SHIVE? No.
If I add "S" to the end: EEKS, QUASHS? No.
Wait:
S + PEEK = SPEEK? No.
S + PINCH = SPINCH? No.
S + ALE = SALE
S + EEK = SEEK
S + HIVE = SHIVE
S + QUASH = SQUASH
Actually:
S + ALE = SALE
S + EEK = SEEK
S + PINCH = SPINCH (No)
S + WIPE = SWIPE (Wait, SWIPE is there).
S + TAP = STAP? No.

Let's re-examine:
Category 1: PINCH, SCROLL, SWIPE, TAP (Touchscreen gestures).
Remaining: ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH.
If you add "S" to the start:
S + ALE = SALE
S + EEK = SEEK
S + HIVE = SHIVE (No)
S + QUASH = SQUASH

Let's look at the remaining again: ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH.
Wait!
S + ALE = SALE
S + EEK = SEEK
S + PAKE? No.
S + PINCH = SPINCH? No.
What if it's S- words?
S + ALE = SALE
S + PEEK (EEK is there) = SEEK
S + QUASH = SQUASH
S + PINCH = SPINCH (No)
S + WIPE (SWIPE is there. Is it WIPE or SWIPE?)
The word is SWIPE.
S + TICK? No.

Let's stick to the most obvious group first.
Touchscreen gestures: PINCH, SCROLL, SWIPE, TAP.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let's verify the connection. 
If we add the letter 'S' to the beginning of each:
S + ALE = SALE
S + EEK = SEEK
S + HIVE = SHIVE (Wait...)
S + QUASH = SQUASH

Let me re-check HIVE. Is there another word?
The words used are: 
BAR, BOOTH, COUNTER, TABLE (Correct)
CHILL, LOAF, LOUNGE, VEG (Correct)
PINCH, SCROLL, SWIPE, TAP (Correct)

The remaining words are definitely: ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH.
Wait, if I add "S" to HIVE I get SHIVE, which is a real word (a thin slice or splinter), but perhaps the connection is "Words that become other words when 'S' is added":
S + ALE = SALE
S + EEK = SEEK
S + HIVE = SHIVE
S + QUASH = SQUASH

Actually, looking closer:
S + ALE = SALE
S + EEK = SEEK
S + QUASH = SQUASH
S + HIVE = SHIVE (or maybe the group is just these four). 

Wait, "Bee" + [word]:
BEE + ALE (No)
BEE + HIVE (Yes)
BEE + STING? (Not there)
BEE + QUASH? (No)

Let's look at the "S" prefix again.
S + ALE = SALE
S + EEK = SEEK
S + HIVE = SHIVE 
S + QUASH = SQUASH
Actually, many Connections puzzles use this "S-prefix" or similar letter-addition trick.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.
