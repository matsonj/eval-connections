PLAYER, SAINT PATRICK, LORDE, BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, SAINT VALENTINE, DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PRESIDENT, PREMIERE, N.F.L. PLAYER, BURNS, BIRD

We need to guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.

Let me analyze the words:

1. MOTHER - could be "Mother" as in mother, or "Mother" as a title
2. M.L.B. PLAYER - Major League Baseball player
3. SAINT PATRICK - Saint Patrick's Day
4. LORDE - The singer Lorde, or "Lord"
5. BISHOP - religious title
6. POPE - religious title
7. CLERGY MEMBER - general religious term
8. SAINT VALENTINE - Saint Valentine's Day
9. DEBUT - first appearance
10. LAUNCH - start, beginning
11. INTRODUCTION - beginning, start
12. PRESIDENT - political title
13. PREMIERE - first showing
14. N.F.L. PLAYER - National Football League player
15. BURNS - could be Robert Burns (poet), or burning
16. BIRD - animal

Let me think about categories:

Category 1: Religious titles/figures
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER
&bull; SAINT PATRICK
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE

But SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE are specific saints, while BISHOP and POPE are titles. CLERGY MEMBER is a general term.

Category 2: Beginnings/firsts
&bull; DEBUT
&bull; LAUNCH
&bull; INTRODUCTION
&bull; PREMIERE

These four are all synonyms for "beginning" or "first appearance".

Category 3: Sports players
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER

Only two though.

Category 4: Titles
&bull; MOTHER (Mother Teresa)
&bull; LORDE (Lord)
&bull; PRESIDENT
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE

Category 5: Specific people
&bull; SAINT PATRICK
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE
&bull; LORDE (the singer)
&bull; BURNS (Robert Burns)
&bull; PRESIDENT (could be a specific president)

Wait, let me think about "BURNS". It could be Robert Burns, the Scottish poet. "BIRD" could be Larry Bird (basketball player). "LORDE" is a singer. "PRESIDENT" could refer to a specific president.

Let me think about the structure. Often in NYT Connections, there are categories like:
&bull; Things that can precede/follow a word
&bull; Synonyms
&bull; Proper nouns with something in common
&bull; etc.

Let me look at DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE - these are clearly all synonyms for "beginning" or "first appearance". That's a strong category of 4 words.

Let me verify:
&bull; DEBUT: first public appearance
&bull; LAUNCH: to start or introduce
&bull; INTRODUCTION: the act of introducing something
&bull; PREMIERE: first performance

Yes, these four fit perfectly as "first appearances" or "beginnings".

So my guess would be: DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE

Let me check if there are any other strong categories:

Religious figures:
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE
&bull; SAINT PATRICK
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE

But SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE are saints' names, while BISHOP and POPE are titles. They could all be "religious figures" though.

Titles:
&bull; MOTHER
&bull; LORDE (Lord)
&bull; PRESIDENT
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE

But "LORDE" is spelled like the singer, not "Lord". However, in all caps, LORDE could be interpreted as LORD-E or just LORD with an extra letter.

Sports:
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER

Only two.

People:
&bull; SAINT PATRICK
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE
&bull; BURNS (Robert Burns)
&bull; BIRD (Larry Bird)
&bull; LORDE (the singer)

This could be "people with days named after them" - Saint Patrick's Day, Saint Valentine's Day, Burns Night (Robert Burns), but Larry Bird doesn't have a day. Or "people with songs named after them" - no.

Wait, could "BIRD" be "The Bird"? Or "Byrd"? 

Let me think differently. Could these be words that can follow other words?

&bull; MOTHER: mother bird, mother bishop? No.
&bull; BIRD: jailbird, bluebird, etc.

Could these be words that can be prefixed with "cardinal"?
&bull; Cardinal bishop? No, bishops are below cardinals.
&bull; Cardinal bird? Yes.
&bull; Cardinal president? No.

Could "BURNS" be "burns" as in injuries? Or "Burns" the poet?

Let me think about "BURNS" and "BIRD" - Larry Bird (NBA), Robert Burns (poet). So "BIRD" and "BURNS" could be surnames of famous people.

LORDE is a singer (Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor).

SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE are saints.

MOTHER could be Mother Teresa.

PRESIDENT could be a specific president.

So maybe there's a category of "people" but that seems too broad.

Let me go back to my first strong category: DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE. These four are very clearly related as synonyms for "first appearance" or "beginning".

Let me check if there are any other words that could fit:
&bull; MOTHER: mother of something? Mother of invention? No.
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER: no
&bull; SAINT PATRICK: no
&bull; LORDE: no
&bull; BISHOP: no
&bull; POPE: no
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER: no
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE: no
&bull; PRESIDENT: no
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER: no
&bull; BURNS: no
&bull; BIRD: no

So DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE seems like the most solid group of 4.

Let me think if there could be any alternative grouping that might be more likely:

Group 1: Religious figures
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER
&bull; SAINT PATRICK (or SAINT VALENTINE)

But CLERGY MEMBER is generic, while the others are specific. And we have two saints.

Actually, wait. Could SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE be grouped with BURNS and maybe another for "people with days named after them"?
&bull; Saint Patrick's Day
&bull; Saint Valentine's Day
&bull; Burns Night (Robert Burns)
&bull; ?

What about MOTHER? Mother's Day. Yes!
&bull; Saint Patrick's Day
&bull; Saint Valentine's Day
&bull; Burns Night
&bull; Mother's Day

But the words are SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER. That seems like a very strong category! These are all "people with holidays named after them".

Let me verify:
&bull; SAINT PATRICK: St. Patrick's Day (March 17)
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE: St. Valentine's Day (February 14)
&bull; BURNS: Robert Burns, Burns Night (January 25)
&bull; MOTHER: Mother's Day (varies by country)

That is a VERY strong category! These are all "people with holidays named after them".

So now I have two strong categories:
1. DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE (beginnings/first appearances)
2. SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER (people with holidays named after them)

Which one is more likely? Both are strong. Let me think about the remaining words for each scenario.

If I use SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER:
Remaining: M.L.B. PLAYER, LORDE, BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PRESIDENT, PREMIERE, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD

From these, I could see:
&bull; Religious: BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, ?
&bull; Sports: M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, ?
&bull; Beginnings: DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE
&bull; Titles: PRESIDENT, BISHOP, POPE, ?

If I use DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE:
Remaining: MOTHER, M.L.B. PLAYER, SAINT PATRICK, LORDE, BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, SAINT VALENTINE, PRESIDENT, N.F.L. PLAYER, BURNS, BIRD

Then: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER could still work for the holiday category.

Actually, both could be valid, but I think the "people with holidays" category is more clever and more specific. The "beginnings" category is a bit more straightforward.

Let me think about the difficulty level. NYT Connections puzzles often have:
&bull; One easy category (like synonyms)
&bull; Two medium categories
&bull; One hard category

The "beginnings" category is probably the easy one.

The "people with holidays" category is more medium/hard.

Let me check the other words more carefully:
&bull; LORDE: could this be "Lord"?
&bull; BIRD: could this be "Bird" as in Larry Bird?
&bull; PRESIDENT: could this be a specific president?

Wait, let me reconsider "LORDE". It's spelled L-O-R-D-E. Could this be a play on "LORD"? If so, it could be a title like:
&bull; LORD
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE
&bull; PRESIDENT

But it's written as LORDE, not LORD. However, in the context of the puzzle, it might be parsed as LORD-E or just intentionally spelled that way.

Alternatively, LORDE could be grouped with BIRDS (the band?), but that seems unlikely.

Let me think about M.L.B. PLAYER and N.F.L. PLAYER. These are two sports professionals. What could they be grouped with? Maybe:
&bull; BIRD (Larry Bird - but he was NBA)
&bull; BURNS (could be a baseball player?)

Actually, "BIRD" could be "The Birds" as in the band? Or "Freebird"? Or "Bird" as in Charlie Parker (jazz musician nicknamed "Bird")?

Hmm, let me think about "BURNS". Could be:
&bull; Robert Burns (poet)
&bull; Ken Burns (documentarian)
&bull; George Burns (comedian)

"BIRD" could be:
&bull; Larry Bird (NBA player)
&bull; Charlie "Bird" Parker (jazz musician)
&bull; The Bird (Muppets)

Let me think about the structure again. Could there be a category of "nicknames"?
&bull; BIRD (nickname)
&bull; BURNS (could be a nickname? Not really)

Or "people known by single names":
&bull; LORDE (the singer)
&bull; BIRD (Charlie Parker)
&bull; BURNS (Robert Burns is often just "Burns")
&bull; POPE? (a specific pope, but usually referred to with number)

Or could "M.L.B. PLAYER" and "N.F.L. PLAYER" be part of a category like "professions that can be preceded by 'all-star'"?
&bull; All-star M.L.B. player
&bull; All-star N.F.L. player
&bull; All-star president? No.

Let me go back to the "people with holidays" category. I think that's very strong:
&bull; SAINT PATRICK (St. Patrick's Day)
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE (Valentine's Day)
&bull; BURNS (Robert Burns Night)
&bull; MOTHER (Mother's Day)

This leaves us with:
M.L.B. PLAYER, LORDE, BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PRESIDENT, PREMIERE, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD

From these, we could have:
1. DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE (beginnings) - easy
2. BISHOP, POPE, PRESIDENT, LORDE? (titles) - but LORDE is spelled wrong
3. M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD?, ? (sports)
4. BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, ? (religious)

Let me check: Can "BIRD" be a religious term? "Bird" in the Bible? Not really.

Can "BIRD" be a sports term? Yes, Larry Bird (basketball). M.L.B. PLAYER and N.F.L. PLAYER are sports. Could "BURNS" be a boxer? Tommy Burns was a boxer. But we already used BURNS in the holiday category.

Wait, if BURNS is used in the holiday category, then we can't use it for sports.

Let me think about "LORDE" again. Could it be grouped with:
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE
&bull; PRESIDENT

as "people with titles"? But LORDE is a stage name, not a title. The singer's title would be "Lorde", but it's not a formal title.

Let me think differently. Could "LORDE" be "Lord" and we need to add an "E" somewhere? This might be a phonetic puzzle.

Wait, let me look at the entire list again:
MOTHER, M.L.B. PLAYER, SAINT PATRICK, LORDE, BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, SAINT VALENTINE, DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PRESIDENT, PREMIERE, N.F.L. PLAYER, BURNS, BIRD

Could there be a category of words that can follow "cardinal"?
&bull; cardinal bishop? No, that's not a thing.

Now I need to make my next guess with the remaining words.

Remaining words: BIRD, BISHOP, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, POPE, PRESIDENT, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

Let me analyze the remaining words:

1. BIRD - could be Larry Bird (NBA player) or Charlie "Bird" Parker
2. BISHOP - religious title
3. BURNS - could be Robert Burns (poet)
4. CLERGY MEMBER - generic religious term
5. LORDE - the singer, or could be "Lord" with an extra E
6. M.L.B. PLAYER - Major League Baseball player
7. MOTHER - could be Mother Teresa
8. N.F.L. PLAYER - National Football League player
9. POPE - religious title
10. PRESIDENT - political title
11. SAINT PATRICK - saint with a holiday
12. SAINT VALENTINE - saint with a holiday

The "people with holidays named after them" category still looks very strong:
&bull; SAINT PATRICK (St. Patrick's Day)
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE (Valentine's Day)
&bull; BURNS (Robert Burns Night)
&bull; MOTHER (Mother's Day)

This is a classic NYT Connections category and very likely correct.

The remaining words would then be:
BIRD, BISHOP, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, POPE, PRESIDENT

From these, I can see:
&bull; Religious titles: BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, and... LORDE? But LORDE is spelled like the singer, not "LORD".
&bull; Sports: M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, and BIRD (Larry Bird) could be a third.
&bull; Titles: BISHOP, POPE, PRESIDENT, and maybe LORDE if interpreted as "Lord"

Let me think about LORDE more carefully. It's spelled L-O-R-D-E. In all caps, this could be:
1. The singer Lorde (stage name)
2. LORD + E (Lord with an extra letter)
3. Could be a typo for LORD

If it's meant to be "Lord", then we have:
&bull; LORD (title)
&bull; BISHOP (title)
&bull; POPE (title)
&bull; PRESIDENT (title)

That's four titles! And they go from religious to political. This seems very plausible.

Then we would have:
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, and maybe CLERGY MEMBER? No.

Wait, if we use BIRD, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, and maybe... BURNS? But BURNS is used in the holiday category.

Let me reconsider: What if the sports category is:
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER (baseball)
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER (football)
&bull; BIRD (Larry Bird - basketball)
&bull; BURNS? Could be a boxer. Tommy Burns was a world heavyweight boxing champion.

But this seems less clean than the titles category.

Let me think about CLERGY MEMBER. It's a generic term, while BISHOP and POPE are specific titles. Could there be a category like "religious roles"?
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER
&bull; SAINT PATRICK or SAINT VALENTINE

But we're using the saints for the holiday category, which is stronger.

Let me stick with my two best categories:
1. SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER (people with holidays)
2. BISHOP, POPE, PRESIDENT, LORDE (if LORDE = Lord, then these are titles)

The second category depends on interpreting LORDE as "Lord", which is plausible in a puzzle context.

Let me make the holiday category guess since it's very clear and less ambiguous.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER

I have 3 incorrect guesses remaining.

Let me reconsider the categories.

Remaining words: BIRD, BISHOP, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, POPE, PRESIDENT, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

My incorrect guess was SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER. So "people with holidays" is not the category, or I'm missing something.

Let me think about BURNS and MOTHER differently.
&bull; BURNS: could be "burns" as in injuries, or "burns" as in George Burns (comedian), or Robert Burns (poet)
&bull; MOTHER: could be "mother" as in parent, or Mother Teresa, or "mother" in other contexts

Maybe the category is something else entirely.

Let me look at all remaining words again:
BIRD, BISHOP, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, POPE, PRESIDENT, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

What if SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE go with BISHOP and POPE as religious figures? That's 4 religious figures (2 saints, 2 high-ranking clergy).

Then the remaining would be:
BIRD, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, PRESIDENT

From these, I could see:
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD (Larry Bird), and maybe BURNS (if there's a famous athlete named Burns). Tommy Burns was a boxer, so that could work: four sports figures/professions.
&bull; Or: CLERGY MEMBER, PRESIDENT, MOTHER, LORDE (as titles/roles) - but this seems weak.

Wait, let me think about "BIRD" again. Could it be not Larry Bird, but something else?
&bull; The Bird (Muppet)
&bull; Bird as in "flip the bird" (gesture)
&bull; Bird as in spy term
&bull; Bird as in Charlie Parker (jazz musician)

And "BURNS": could it be Ken Burns (documentarian), George Burns (comedian), or just the verb/noun.

Let me think about "LORDE" again. Could it be grouped with:
&bull; BIRD (as in "Freebird"? No)
&bull; BURNS (no obvious connection)
&bull; POPE? No, we already removed POPE

What if LORDE is meant to be parsed as "LORD-E"?
Or is it just the singer Lorde? If so, what category would include a singer?

Maybe: LORDE (singer), BIRD (Charlie Parker, also had a nickname "Bird"), BURNS (Ken Burns or George Burns, entertainers), and... MOTHER? Mother (the band)? Or Mother Teresa?

That seems too scattered.

Let me think about "MOTHER" and "PRESIDENT" and "BISHOP" and "POPE" - these are all titles. But I used BISHOP and POPE in the religious category idea.

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider the whole puzzle structure.

Original words were:
MOTHER, M.L.B. PLAYER, SAINT PATRICK, LORDE, BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, SAINT VALENTINE, DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PRESIDENT, PREMIERE, N.F.L. PLAYER, BURNS, BIRD

We already used: DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE (beginnings)

Remaining: MOTHER, M.L.B. PLAYER, SAINT PATRICK, LORDE, BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, SAINT VALENTINE, PRESIDENT, N.F.L. PLAYER, BURNS, BIRD

My incorrect guess tried to use SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER.

So maybe SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE don't go together with BURNS and MOTHER.

What if SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE go with BISHOP and POPE as religious figures?

Then we're left with:
MOTHER, M.L.B. PLAYER, LORDE, CLERGY MEMBER, PRESIDENT, N.F.L. PLAYER, BURNS, BIRD

From these, I can see:
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD (Larry Bird), BURNS (Tommy Burns, boxer) = four sports figures/types
&bull; MOTHER, PRESIDENT, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE (if Lord = title) = four titles/roles

The sports category seems stronger: M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER are specific sports. BIRD is Larry Bird (basketball). BURNS could be Tommy Burns (boxing champion), or there might be another famous athlete named Burns.

Alternatively, BURNS could be George Burns (comedian), but that would make it entertainment instead of sports.

Let me check: George Burns was an entertainer, Ken Burns is a documentarian, Robert Burns is a poet. None are athletes except Tommy Burns.

But Tommy Burns is less well-known than Larry Bird. In NYT puzzles, they usually use very well-known references.

What if the category is "people with single-word names/nicknames"?
&bull; LORDE (singer)
&bull; BIRD (Charlie Parker or Larry Bird)
&bull; BURNS (George Burns or Robert Burns)
&bull; PRESIDENT? No, that's not a specific person.

Hmm.

Let me think about "CLERGY MEMBER". It's generic. Could it be grouped with other generic terms?
&bull; PLAYER (but we don't have "PLAYER" alone, we have M.L.B. PLAYER and N.F.L. PLAYER)
&bull; PRESIDENT (generic title)
&bull; MOTHER (generic term)

What if the category is "generic roles/titles"?
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER
&bull; PRESIDENT
&bull; MOTHER
&bull; PLAYER? But we don't have "PLAYER" alone.

Wait, we have M.L.B. PLAYER and N.F.L. PLAYER. Could "PLAYER" be extracted? The puzzle might be asking us to focus on the "PLAYER" part.

But that seems unlikely.

Let me go back to the sports idea. If I group:
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER (baseball)
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER (football)
&bull; BIRD (Larry Bird, basketball)
&bull; LORDE? No.

What about grouping by initials/acronyms?
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER: M.L.B.
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER: N.F.L.
&bull; LORDE: L-O-R-D-E
&bull; BIRD: B-I-R-D

No obvious pattern.

Let me think about "BURNS". Could it be grouped with "MOTHER", "LORDE", "BIRD" as things that can follow "lady"?
&bull; Lady Bird (movie, also LBJ's wife)
&bull; Lady L? No.
&bull; Lady Mother? No.
&bull; Lady Burns? No.

What about "free"?
&bull; Free bird (song)
&bull; Free will? No.

What about "fire"?
&bull; Firebird
&bull; Fire burns
&bull; Fire lord? No.

Wait, "lord" and "bird" and "mother" and "president" could all be followed by "s":
&bull; lords
&bull; birds
&bull; mothers
&bull; presidents

But that's just pluralization.

Let me think about "BIRD" as the creature. Could there be a category of animals?
&bull; BIRD
&bull; No other animals in the list.

What about "BIRD", "BURNS", "LORDE", "MOTHER" as types of something? I'm stuck.

Let me reconsider the religious category:
SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, POPE (four religious figures)

Then I have:
BIRD, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, PRESIDENT

Now, can I find two groups of four here?

Group 1: Sports
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER
&bull; BIRD (Larry Bird)
&bull; BURNS (Tommy Burns - boxer)

Group 2: Titles
&bull; MOTHER
&bull; PRESIDENT
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER
&bull; LORDE? (if Lord)

This could work. The only question is whether Tommy Burns is well-known enough. Let me verify: Tommy Burns was the World Heavyweight Boxing Champion from 1906-1908. He's in the International Boxing Hall of Fame. This seems plausible for NYT.

The titles category is also a bit questionable because LORDE is spelled like the singer, not "Lord". But in all caps, it could be interpreted either way.

Alternatively, maybe BURNS refers to someone else. Could "burns" be a term in sports? Like "burns" meaning fast? No.

What if BURNS is grouped with SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE differently? Like "things associated with specific days"?
&bull; Saint Patrick's Day
&bull; Saint Valentine's Day
&bull; Burns Night
&bull; Mother's Day

But I already tried that combination and it was wrong. So maybe BURNS doesn't go with the saints.

Let me try a different approach. Could there be a phonetic component?
&bull; LORDE sounds like "lord"
&bull; BIRD sounds like "bird"
&bull; BURNS sounds like "burns"

What if the category is about words that can follow "free"?
&bull; Free bird (song by Lynyrd Skynyrd)
&bull; Free will? No "will" in the list.
&bull; Free world? No "world".
&bull; Free love? No "love".

What about "fire"?
&bull; Firebird
&bull; Fire burns
&bull; Fire lord? No "lord" (LORDE is there)
&bull; Fire mother? No.

What about "lady"?
&bull; Lady Bird (movie, also nickname for LBJ's wife)
&bull; Lady L? No.
&bull; Lady Mother? No.
&bull; Lady Burns? No.

Let me think about "mother", "bird", "president", "bishop" - these could all be preceded by "madam"?
&bull; Madam Mother? No.
&bull; Madam President? Yes.
&bull; Madam Bishop? No.

What about "father"?
&bull; Father Mother? No.

Let me think about "pregnant":
&bull; Pregnant mother - yes
&bull; Pregnant bird? No.

I'm stuck. Let me try the religious figures category and see if that leads somewhere.

Guess: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, POPE

This seems safe. They're all religious figures. Let me go with that.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, POPE
&lt;/guess&gt;

I have 2 incorrect guesses remaining.

This is getting tricky. Let me reconsider all the remaining words:
BIRD, BISHOP, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, POPE, PRESIDENT, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

My two incorrect guesses were:
1. SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER (people with holidays)
2. SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, POPE (religious figures)

So SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE don't go together with BURNS/MOTHER, and they don't go together with BISHOP/POPE.

Let me think differently. Maybe the saints go with different words.

Could SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE go with CLERGY MEMBER and... something else?
&bull; SAINT PATRICK (specific saint)
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE (specific saint)
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER (generic religious role)
&bull; POPE or BISHOP?

But I already tried SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, POPE and it was wrong. So maybe they don't go with BISHOP or POPE.

What about SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, CLERGY MEMBER, and... PRESIDENT? No, that doesn't make sense.

Maybe the saints DON'T go together. Maybe SAINT PATRICK goes in one group and SAINT VALENTINE in another.

Let me look at all words again and try to find four completely different groups.

Group 1 (already solved): DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE

Remaining:
BIRD, BISHOP, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, POPE, PRESIDENT, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

Possible categories I'm seeing:
1. Sports/professions: M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD (Larry Bird), BURNS (Tommy Burns - boxer)
2. Titles: MOTHER, PRESIDENT, BISHOP, POPE (but LORDE is there too)
3. Religious: Maybe CLERGY MEMBER, BISHOP, POPE, and one of the saints?
4. Something with LORDE, BURNS, BIRD, ???

Let me think about that last one. Could LORDE, BURNS, BIRD, and maybe MOTHER or SAINT... be a category of "people with single-word names"?
&bull; LORDE (singer)
&bull; BIRD (Larry Bird or Charlie Parker)
&bull; BURNS (George Burns or Robert Burns)
&bull; MOTHER (Mother Teresa, though she's usually "Mother Teresa")

But this seems vague.

What if the category is "words that can be preceded by 'lady'"?
&bull; Lady Bird (movie)
&bull; Lady L? No.
&bull; Lady Mother? No.
&bull; Lady Burns? No.

What if it's "words that can be followed by 's'" to make a plural? That's too trivial.

Let me think about "LORDE" again. Could it be a homophone or wordplay?
&bull; LORDE = LORD + E
&bull; Could be "Lord" (title)
&bull; Could be the singer

If it's "Lord", then a titles category could be:
&bull; LORD (from LORDE)
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE
&bull; PRESIDENT

That's four titles! And it leaves:
BIRD, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

Now from these, I could see:
&bull; Sports: M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD (Larry Bird), and maybe BURNS (Tommy Burns)
&bull; Religious: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, CLERGY MEMBER, MOTHER (Mother Teresa)

But wait, I tried SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER and it was wrong. So maybe MOTHER doesn't go with the saints.

What about SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, CLERGY MEMBER, and... POPE? But POPE is in the titles category in this scenario.

Let me try a different grouping:

Titles: BISHOP, POPE, PRESIDENT, LORDE (as Lord)
Sports: M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, BURNS

That leaves: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, CLERGY MEMBER, MOTHER

What could these four be? 
&bull; SAINT PATRICK (male saint)
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE (male saint)
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER (generic)
&bull; MOTHER (female parent or religious title)

Could this be "people with days named after them"? 
&bull; St. Patrick's Day
&bull; St. Valentine's Day
&bull; Mother's Day
&bull; Clergy... Day? No, there's no Clergy Day.

What about "types of religious figures"?
&bull; SAINT PATRICK (saint)
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE (saint)
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER (clergy)
&bull; MOTHER (Mother Teresa, but also just "mother" as in nun)

This could be a category of "religious designations" or "church titles/roles".

But I already tried something similar with the saints and it was wrong. However, that was saints + bishop + pope. This is saints + clergy member + mother, which is different.

Let me try: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, CLERGY MEMBER, MOTHER

No wait, let me think more carefully. The saints are specific people. Mother is specific (Mother Teresa). Clergy member is generic. This doesn't fit well.

What if MOTHER goes with BISHOP, POPE, and LORDE as titles that can be preceded by "holy"?
&bull; Holy Mother
&bull; Holy Bishop? Not commonly.
&bull; Holy Pope? Sometimes "His Holiness the Pope"
&bull; Holy Lord? Yes.

That's not strong.

What if MOTHER, BIRD, BURNS, LORDE are all entertainers?
&bull; MOTHER - the band Mother Mother, or "Mother" as in mother of something
&bull; BIRD - Charlie "Bird" Parker (jazz)
&bull; BURNS - George Burns (comedian) or Robert Burns (poet)
&bull; LORDE - singer

This is too obscure.

Let me think about "BIRD" and "BURNS" as surnames of famous people:
&bull; Larry Bird
&bull; Robert Burns
&bull; Ken Burns
&bull; George Burns

And "LORDE" is a stage name (Ella Yelich-O'Connor).

And "MOTHER" could be "Mother Teresa" or just the concept.

What if the category is "one-word names of famous people"?
&bull; BIRD (Larry Bird)
&bull; BURNS (Robert Burns)
&bull; LORDE (singer)
&bull; MOTHER (Mother Teresa)

This could work. But it's a bit vague.

Alternatively, maybe it's "words that can follow 'soul'"?
&bull; Soul mother? No.
&bull; Soul bird? No.

What about "words that can follow 'mother'"?
&bull; Mother bird (a bird that is a mother)
&bull; Mother lode? No, "lode" not "lorde"
&bull; Mother burns? No.

Wait, "lode" vs "lorde" - could be a pun! MOTHER LODE is a phrase (rich source). But the word is LORDE, not LODE.

Let me think about the structure differently. What if some words need to be parsed differently?

M.L.B. PLAYER = baseball player
N.F.L. PLAYER = football player
SAINT PATRICK = saint
SAINT VALENTINE = saint

Could there be a category of abbreviations vs full words?
&bull; M.L.B. (abbreviation)
&bull; N.F.L. (abbreviation)
&bull; SAINT (full word, though part of name)
&bull; Something else?

This doesn't seem right.

Let me try to force the sports category:
M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD (Larry Bird), BURNS (???)

If BURNS doesn't fit, what else could? MOTHER? No. SAINT? No.

Wait, what if "BURNS" is a reference to "burns" as in "rope burns" or something that happens in sports? That seems too vague.

Let me think about "CLERGY MEMBER". It's the only generic term. Maybe it's a distractor.

What if the four groups are:
1. DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE (done)
2. M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, BURNS (sports)
3. BISHOP, POPE, PRESIDENT, LORDE (titles)
4. SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER, CLERGY MEMBER (???)

What could that last group be? "Words that can be preceded by 'holy'"?
&bull; Holy Saint Patrick? Redundant.
&bull; Holy Saint Valentine? Redundant.
&bull; Holy Mother? Yes.
&bull; Holy clergy member? No.

"Words that can follow 'St.' or 'Saint'"?
&bull; St. Patrick
&bull; St. Valentine
&bull; St. Mother? No.
&bull; St. Clergy? No.

What if MOTHER and CLERGY MEMBER go with M.L.B. PLAYER and N.F.L. PLAYER as "types of... something"? No.

Let me think about "MOTHER" differently. Could it be "mother" as in "motherboard"? No other computer terms.

Could it be "mother" as in "mother lode"? Wait, that's interesting. MOTHER LODE is a phrase. And LORDE is spelled like LODE with an extra R. Could there be a pun here?

If LORDE is meant to evoke LODE, then:
&bull; MOTHER LODE (rich source of something)
&bull; Something else?

No, that's too much of a stretch.

Let me think about the saints again. They both have "SAINT" in their names. The other words with titles are:
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE
&bull; PRESIDENT
&bull; LORDE (if Lord)
&bull; MOTHER
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER

What if the category is about the TITLE itself vs the PERSON?

The saints have "Saint" in their names, but they are saints.
Bishop and Pope are titles.
President is a title.
Mother can be a title.
Lord can be a title.
Clergy member is a description.

What if SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE form a category with two other saints? But there are no other saints.

Wait, what if "SAINT PATRICK" and "SAINT VALENTINE" are not grouped by "saint" but by something else? Like they both have days named after them, but I already tried that and it was wrong. So maybe the category is just the saints themselves, and they go with two other religious figures that DON'T have "saint" in their name?

SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, POPE - I tried that, it was wrong.

SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, CLERGY MEMBER - this is different. Two saints, one specific title (bishop), one generic term (clergy member).

Or: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, MOTHER (Mother Teresa is considered a saint).

But Mother Teresa is Saint Teresa of Calcutta now, but the word is just "MOTHER".

Let me try: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, MOTHER

No wait, before I guess again, I need to be more systematic.

I have to find 4 groups of 4. One is solved.

Remaining: BIRD, BISHOP, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, POPE, PRESIDENT, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

Let me list all possible categories I can see:

Category A: Sports
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER
&bull; BIRD (Larry Bird)
&bull; Need a fourth: BURNS (Tommy Burns, boxer) or maybe something else

Category B: Religious titles
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE
&bull; PRESIDENT? No, not religious
&bull; LORDE? If Lord, yes
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER? This is generic
&bull; SAINT PATRICK? No, he's a saint
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE? No

Category C: Saints/religious figures
&bull; SAINT PATRICK
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE
&bull; BISHOP? No, bishop isn't necessarily a saint
&bull; POPE? Popes can be saints, but not all

Category D: People with holidays (already tried, was wrong)
&bull; SAINT PATRICK
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE
&bull; BURNS
&bull; MOTHER

Category E: Titles/roles
&bull; MOTHER
&bull; PRESIDENT
&bull; BISHOP
&bull; POPE
&bull; LORDE (if Lord)
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER (generic)

Category F: One-word names of famous people
&bull; BIRD (Larry Bird)
&bull; BURNS (Robert Burns, Ken Burns, George Burns)
&bull; LORDE (singer)
&bull; MOTHER (Mother Teresa)

Let me evaluate each:

Category A (sports) seems plausible: M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD (Larry Bird), BURNS (Tommy Burns). All are athletes/professions in sports.

Category F (one-word names) also seems plausible: BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, MOTHER. All can refer to specific famous people.

If I combine these two, that leaves:
&bull; BISHOP, CLERGY MEMBER, POPE, PRESIDENT, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

From these, I could make:
&bull; Religious: BISHOP, POPE, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE? I tried this, it was wrong.
&bull; Something else: CLERGY MEMBER, PRESIDENT, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE? Doesn't work.

Wait, I tried SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, POPE and it was wrong. So maybe the saints can't both be in the same group as each other, or can't be with bishop and pope.

What if one saint goes with bishop, pope, and clergy member? No, that's only 4 if we include both saints.

What if the saints are split up? That seems unlikely for a puzzle.

Let me reconsider the sports category. M.L.B. PLAYER and N.F.L. PLAYER are specific professions. BIRD is a specific person (Larry Bird). BURNS could be a specific person (Tommy Burns).

But maybe there's a different sports grouping. What if it's about the TEAM or the ANIMAL?
&bull; BIRD: Atlanta Birds? No.
&bull; BURNS: no.

Another idea: Could M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, CLERGY MEMBER, and PRESIDENT all be "positions" or "roles"? Yes! They're all roles/positions.

Then we'd have:
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER (role)
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER (role)
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER (role)
&bull; PRESIDENT (role)

That's four roles! Then we'd have:
BIRD, BISHOP, BURNS, LORDE, MOTHER, POPE, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

From these, I see:
&bull; Religious titles: BISHOP, POPE, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE? Already tried, was wrong.
&bull; Something else: BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, MOTHER (famous people with one-word names)

But wait, I said SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, POPE was wrong. So that can't be the grouping.

What if BISHOP and POPE are not together? What if BISHOP is with SAINT PATRICK (since Patrick was a bishop) and SAINT VALENTINE is with... someone else?

Actually, Saint Patrick was a bishop! And Saint Valentine was a priest (and possibly a bishop). So maybe:
&bull; SAINT PATRICK (bishop saint)
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE (priest/bishop saint)
&bull; BISHOP (title)
&bull; POPE (title)

But I tried this and it was wrong. So maybe the puzzle doesn't consider them similar enough.

What about grouping by "can be preceded by 'holy'"?
&bull; Holy Mother: yes
&bull; Holy Father (Pope): yes
&bull; Holy Lord: yes
&bull; Holy Spirit? Not in list.
&bull; Holy Saint? Redundant.

This doesn't work.

Let me think about "MOTHER" and "LORDE". Could there be a music category?
&bull; LORDE (singer)
&bull; BIRD (Charlie Parker, jazz musician known as "Bird")
&bull; BURNS (could be a musician? There's a band "Burns")
&bull; MOTHER (band "Mother Mother")

This is too obscure for NYT.

Let me go back to the most solid categories:
1. DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE (solved)
2. M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, BURNS (sports)
3. BISHOP, POPE, PRESIDENT, LORDE (titles)
4. SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, CLERGY MEMBER, MOTHER (???)

What could that last one be? "Religious designations"?
&bull; SAINT PATRICK (saint)
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE (saint)
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER (generic religious role)
&bull; MOTHER (specific religious title, like Mother Teresa)

This could work. It's different from my previous guess because I previously had BURNS and MOTHER with the saints. Now I'm trying CLERGY MEMBER and MOTHER with the saints.

Let me try: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, CLERGY MEMBER, MOTHER

Wait, I have only 2 guesses left. I should try the sports category first, as it's more concrete.

Sports category: M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD (Larry Bird), BURNS (Tommy Burns)

This seems solid. Let me go with this.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, BURNS
&lt;/guess&gt;

PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, BURNS was incorrect. I have only 1 incorrect guess remaining, which means I must get the next guess right or I lose.

This is critical. I need to be very careful.

Remaining words: BIRD, BISHOP, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, POPE, PRESIDENT, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

I've tried:
1. SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER - wrong
2. SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, POPE - wrong
3. M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, BURNS - wrong

So the categories are NOT:
&bull; Saints + holidays
&bull; Saints + bishop + pope (religious figures)
&bull; Sports figures

Let me think again about what's left.

The words are: BIRD, BISHOP, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, POPE, PRESIDENT, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

I need to find four groups of four. One is solved:
1. DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE (beginnings)

I need to find three more groups of four.

Let me think about the structure differently. What if the groups are based on wordplay or parsing?

M.L.B. PLAYER and N.F.L. PLAYER both have "PLAYER" and an acronym. Maybe they need to be separated from PLAYER?

What if "PLAYER" is a separate concept? But the word is "M.L.B. PLAYER" as a whole.

Let me think about "LORDE". Could it be a homophone for "lord"? Or is it just the singer?

If LORDE is the singer, could there be a category of entertainers?
&bull; LORDE (singer)
&bull; BIRD (Charlie Parker, jazz musician)
&bull; BURNS (George Burns, comedian)
&bull; ?

Who would be the fourth? MOTHER could be "Mother" as in Mother Teresa (not an entertainer) or "Mother" as in the band Mother Mother (obscure).

What about "PRESIDENT"? There are movies about presidents. No.

Let me think about "BURNS" differently. Could it be "burns" as a verb, not a name? What category would include "burns" as a verb?

Fire burns, acid burns, etc. Could there be a category of words related to fire?
&bull; BURNS (verb)
&bull; BIRD (phoenix? Too obscure)
&bull; L? No.

Let me think about SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE. They both:
&bull; Are saints
&bull; Have holidays named after them
&bull; Are associated with specific symbols (shamrock, heart)

Could the category be about their symbols? No, the symbols aren't in the list.

What if they go with BIRD and BURNS? Could there be a connection?
&bull; Saint Patrick's bird? No.
&bull; Saint Valentine's bird? Dove? Not in list.
&bull; Burns? No.

Let me think about "MOTHER" and "PRESIDENT" and "POPE". Could these be leaders?
&bull; Mother (as in Mother Teresa, leader of her order)
&bull; President (political leader)
&bull; Pope (religious leader)
&bull; Bishop? (religious leader)

So: MOTHER, PRESIDENT, POPE, BISHOP - four types of leaders!

Let me check:
&bull; Mother Teresa was a leader of her religious order
&bull; President is a political leader
&bull; Pope is the leader of Catholic Church
&bull; Bishop is a religious leader

This works! And it's different from my previous tries.

If this is correct, then the remaining words would be:
BIRD, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

Now I need to find two groups of four here.

One group could be SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, CLERGY MEMBER, and... LORDE? No.
What about SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER? No obvious connection.

What about BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, SAINT PATRICK? No.

Wait, let me think about the saints differently. They both have "SAINT" in their names. The other words that have official titles are M.L.B. PLAYER and N.F.L. PLAYER (they have acronyms).

Could SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE form a group with two other saints? But there are no other saints.

What if SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE are grouped with CLERGY MEMBER and LORDE? Doesn't make sense.

Let me think about "BIRD" and "BURNS". Could they be last names of famous people?
&bull; Larry Bird (basketball)
&bull; Robert Burns (poet)
&bull; George Burns (comedian)
&bull; Ken Burns (documentarian)

And "LORDE" is a stage name (singer).
And "SAINT PATRICK/VALENTINE" are saints' names.
And "M.L.B. PLAYER/N.F.L. PLAYER" are professions.

What if there's a category of "specific people vs generic terms"?
&bull; Specific: BIRD (Larry Bird), BURNS (Robert/George/Ken Burns), LORDE (singer), SAINT PATRICK (person), SAINT VALENTINE (person)
&bull; Generic: M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, CLERGY MEMBER

But I need groups of 4.

Let me think about "M.L.B. PLAYER" and "N.F.L. PLAYER". They both end in "PLAYER". Could "PLAYER" be a separate word? No, the whole phrase is the word.

What if the category is about the ACRONYMS?
&bull; M.L.B. (Major League Baseball)
&bull; N.F.L. (National Football League)
&bull; SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE don't have acronyms.

No.

Let me go back to the leaders idea: MOTHER, PRESIDENT, POPE, BISHOP

This seems strong. Let me commit to that.

Now for the remaining: BIRD, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

Could SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE be a group? No.

What about M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE? Could the connection be "people who have been honored with parades"? 
&bull; M.L.B. players have parades when they win World Series
&bull; N.F.L. players have parades when they win Super Bowl
&bull; Saint Patrick's Day parade
&bull; Saint Valentine's Day parade? Not really.

What about "BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, SAINT VALENTINE"? No.

Let me think about "BIRD" and "BURNS" and "LORDE" differently. Could they all be preceded by "lady"?
&bull; Lady Bird (movie, nickname for LBJ's wife)
&bull; Lady L? No.
&bull; Lady Burns? No.

What about "free"?
&bull; Free bird (song)
&bull; Free lord? No.
&bull; Free burns? No.

What about "fire"?
&bull; Firebird
&bull; Fire burns (makes sense)
&bull; Fire lord? Could be in fantasy
&bull; Fire saint? No.

No.

Let me think about "CLERGY MEMBER" and "M.L.B. PLAYER" and "N.F.L. PLAYER". These are all "roles" or "professions".

What if the group is: CLERGY MEMBER, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, and... BIRD? No, Bird is a person, not a profession.

What if it's: CLERGY MEMBER, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, and PRESIDENT? But I used PRESIDENT in the leaders category.

Let me reconsider my leaders category. If it's wrong, I lose.

MOTHER, PRESIDENT, POPE, BISHOP - all leaders. This seems solid.

If that's NOT correct, then what could MOTHER, PRESIDENT, POPE, BISHOP be?
&bull; They are all titles
&bull; They are all positions of authority
&bull; They can all be preceded by "holy" (Holy Mother, Holy Father [Pope], Holy Lord? No for Bishop)

Actually, "His Holiness" is for the Pope, not bishops. "Holy Father" is Pope. "Holy Mother" is a term. "Holy Lord" is a term. But "Holy Bishop" and "Holy President" are not standard.

So "holy" doesn't work.

What about "your"?
&bull; Your Mother
&bull; Your President
&bull; Your Pope? Not really.
&bull; Your Bishop? Not really.

What about "the"?
&bull; The Mother? Not specific.
&bull; The President? Yes.
&bull; The Pope? Yes.
&bull; The Bishop? Not specific.

I'm confident in MOTHER, PRESIDENT, POPE, BISHOP as leaders.

So the remaining groups must be:
Group 1: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER? No.
Group 2: BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, CLERGY MEMBER? No.

Wait, what if SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE are grouped with BIRD and BURNS as "people with one-word nicknames/names"?
&bull; St. Patrick
&bull; St. Valentine
&bull; Bird
&bull; Burns

But this leaves: CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER

Could these be "generic vs specific"? 
&bull; CLERGY MEMBER (generic)
&bull; LORDE (specific person)
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER (generic profession)
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER (generic profession)

No, that's not a clean category.

What if LORDE, BIRD, BURNS, and SAINT PATRICK/VALENTINE are all "names that can stand alone"?
&bull; LORDE (stage name)
&bull; BIRD (nickname)
&bull; BURNS (surname)
&bull; SAINT PATRICK (first name? No)

This doesn't work.

Let me think about "M.L.B. PLAYER" and "N.F.L. PLAYER" - maybe they need to be grouped with "SAINT PATRICK" and "SAINT VALENTINE" in a category about "abbreviations"?
&bull; M.L.B. is an abbreviation
&bull; N.F.L. is an abbreviation
&bull; Saint is not an abbreviation.

No.

What if the category is about "people who have parades"?
&bull; M.L.B. champions (World Series parade)
&bull; N.F.L. champions (Super Bowl parade)
&bull; Saint Patrick (St. Patrick's Day parade)
&bull; Someone else for Saint Valentine's Day? Not really.

No.

Let me think about "CLERGY MEMBER". Could this be a distractor word that goes with SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, and maybe POPE or BISHOP? But I already tried saints with pope/bishop.

What if it's SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, CLERGY MEMBER, and... LORDE? No.

I'm running out of ideas. Let me think about the puzzle's difficulty.
Often there's:
1. Easy group (synonyms) - DONE
2. Medium group (obvious theme)
3. Medium-hard group (less obvious)
4. Hard group (wordplay)

My leader group (MOTHER, PRESIDENT, POPE, BISHOP) is medium.

The remaining words: BIRD, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE

What if CLERGY MEMBER, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER are all "roles", and the fourth is SAINT? But SAINT is part of a name, not a standalone role in the list.

Wait, what if SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE are grouped with M.L.B. PLAYER and N.F.L. PLAYER as "people who have been depicted in movies or have entertainment value"?
&bull; Saint Patrick (movies about him)
&bull; Saint Valentine (movies about him)
&bull; M.L.B. players (in sports movies)
&bull; N.F.L. players (in sports movies)

This is too vague.

Let me think about "BIRD" and "BURNS" as surnames, "LORDE" as stage name, and "SAINT..." as people known by their saint names.

So: BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, and either SAINT PATRICK or SAINT VALENTINE? No, need 4.

What if it's BIRD, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, and something else?

I'm stuck. Let me try a different grouping.

What if CLERGY MEMBER is the key to the religious group?
CLERGY MEMBER, SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, and... BISHOP? But I tried saints with bishop.

Wait, I tried SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, POPE. That's different from SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, CLERGY MEMBER.

Let me try: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BISHOP, CLERGY MEMBER

This is four religious figures/roles. Two saints, one specific title, one generic term. This could be the category.

Then the remaining would be:
BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, MOTHER, N.F.L. PLAYER, POPE, PRESIDENT

From these, I already have my leaders group: MOTHER, POPE, PRESIDENT, and... what? I need a fourth leader.

BISHOP is a leader, but I just used him in the saints group.
Could LORDE be a "leader"? No.
Could BIRD be a "leader"? "Bird" as in "jailbird"? No.
Could BURNS be a "leader"? No.

What if my leaders group is wrong?

Let me think about MOTHER, POPE, PRESIDENT, and BISHOP. If this is wrong, what else could they be?

They are all titles. Could there be a different fourth title? LORDE (if Lord) could be a title.

But if I need to find a group for MOTHER, POPE, PRESIDENT, and BISHOP, and I can't use BISHOP because it's in the saints group, then my saints group is wrong.

Let me try a different saints group: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, and two others that aren't BISHOP or POPE.

What if the saints go with MOTHER and CLERGY MEMBER?
SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER (Mother Teresa), CLERGY MEMBER

Are these all "religious figures"? Yes, they are. Mother Teresa is now Saint Teresa of Calcutta, but the word is "MOTHER". This could be the category: three saints and one clergy member.

But is Mother Teresa considered a saint? Yes, she was canonized in 2016.

So: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER (as in Mother Teresa, a saint), CLERGY MEMBER (someone who could become a saint)

This is a bit of a stretch because CLERGY MEMBER is generic.

Alternatively, maybe it's SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER TERESA (but the word is just MOTHER), and CLERGY MEMBER.

I think this is too ambiguous.

Let me try to think of the hardest possible group. Could there be a phonetic group?

BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, SAINT VALENTINE
&bull; Bird
&bull; Burns
&bull; Lorde
&bull; Saint Valentine

No obvious connection.

What if it's about what comes AFTER these words?
&bull; Bird call
&bull; Burns? Nothing.
&bull; Lorde? Nothing.
&bull; Saint Patrick's Day
&bull; Saint Valentine's Day
&bull; Mother Nature
&bull; President's Day

Wait, SAINT PATRICK'S DAY, SAINT VALENTINE'S DAY, PRESIDENT'S DAY, and... MOTHER'S DAY!

So: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER, PRESIDENT - all have holidays named after them!

But I tried SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, BURNS, MOTHER and it was wrong. So maybe PRESIDENT is the key, not BURNS.

Let me try: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER, PRESIDENT

These all have holidays:
&bull; Saint Patrick's Day
&bull; Saint Valentine's Day
&bull; Mother's Day
&bull; President's Day

This is a very clean category! And it's different from my previous guess which used BURNS instead of PRESIDENT.

If this is correct, then the remaining words are:
BIRD, BISHOP, BURNS, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, POPE

From these, I can see:
&bull; Sports: M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD (Larry Bird), and BURNS (Tommy Burns)
&bull; Religious titles: BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, and LORDE (if Lord is a title)

This would give me four clean groups:
1. DEBUT, LAUNCH, INTRODUCTION, PREMIERE (beginnings)
2. SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER, PRESIDENT (people with holidays)
3. M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, BURNS (sports figures)
4. BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE (religious titles/roles)

This seems very logical. But I already used BURNS in a sports guess and it was wrong. So maybe BURNS isn't Tommy Burns.

What else could BURNS be? Could it be "burns" as in "sunburns"? Then what group would it fit in?

If BURNS is not a sports figure, then my sports group is wrong.

What could M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, and someone else be?
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER (baseball)
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER (football)
&bull; BIRD (Larry Bird, basketball)
&bull; The fourth could be LORDE? No.
&bull; The fourth could be BURNS (if Burns is a boxer)
&bull; The fourth could be PRESIDENT (if President is a baseball team? No)

I think the sports group is correct, and BURNS must be Tommy Burns. Maybe my previous guess was wrong because I paired it with the wrong words? No, I guessed M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, BURNS and it was marked incorrect.

So maybe the sports group is not M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, BURNS.

What if the group is M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, and two others that are not BIRD and BURNS?

What other sports-related words are there? None.

So maybe M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, and BURNS are not the sports group.

What if BIRD and BURNS are grouped with LORDE and CLERGY MEMBER? No.

Let me think about BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, and SAINT... Could these all be people known by single names?
&bull; Bird (Larry Bird)
&bull; Burns (Robert Burns)
&bull; Lorde (singer)
&bull; Saint? No, Saint Patrick and Saint Valentine are two words.

What if it's BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, and POPE? Pope is sometimes used alone, as in "the Pope".

But then what happens to SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE? They must go together, right?

I'm running out of time. Let me think about the most likely groupings:

Option 1: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER, PRESIDENT (people with holidays)
Option 2: BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE (religious titles)
Option 3: M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, BIRD, BURNS (sports)

I believe in option 1 strongly. It's clean and logical.

I believe in option 2 moderately. It requires accepting LORDE as "Lord", but that's plausible.

I believe in option 3 weakly because my previous guess with these four was wrong. But maybe I was wrong about BURNS being Tommy Burns?

What if BURNS is not Tommy Burns? What if BURNS is grouped with BIRD, LORDE, and something else entirely?

Could BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, and ONE OF THE SAINTS be a group of "people with unusual names"?
&bull; Bird (nickname)
&bull; Burns (surname)
&bull; Lorde (stage name)
&bull; Saint Valentine or Saint Patrick (title + name)

This would split up the saints, which seems unlikely.

What if the group is M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER, CLERGY MEMBER, and PRESIDENT? These are all "roles" or "positions".

Then we'd have:
&bull; SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER, ??? (people with holidays)
&bull; BIRD, BURNS, LORDE, BISHOP/POPE? No.

This doesn't work.

I'm going to trust my holiday group: SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER, PRESIDENT

And I'm going to trust the religious titles group: BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE

This leaves: BIRD, BURNS, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER

These must be a group. The only connection is sports. M.L.B. PLAYER is baseball, N.F.L. PLAYER is football, BIRD is Larry Bird (basketball), and BURNS must be a sports figure.

Tommy Burns was a boxer, which is a sport. Maybe my previous guess was marked wrong for a different reason? Or maybe BURNS is someone else?

Another sports figure named Burns: Jerry Burns (NFL coach), Mark Burns (golfer), Tommy Burns (boxer). The boxer is the most famous.

I think my logic is sound. The categories are:
1. Beginnings (solved)
2. People with holidays (SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER, PRESIDENT)
3. Religious titles (BISHOP, POPE, CLERGY MEMBER, LORDE)
4. Sports figures (BIRD, BURNS, M.L.B. PLAYER, N.F.L. PLAYER)

I've already guessed group 4 and was told it was wrong. But maybe I need to guess in a different order?

The puzzle might require me to guess the groups in a specific sequence. Let me try group 2 now.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, MOTHER, PRESIDENT

2. <b>Camera brands</b>: FUJIFILM, HASSELBLAD, OLYMPUS, and POLAROID are all well-known camera and photography companies.

3. <b>Trademarked brand names</b>: ASTROTURF, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, and CREAMSICLE were all originally trademarked brand names that later became genericized terms.

4. <b>Sports-related terms</b>: JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE (as in "Mount Rushmore of sports"), SCOREBOARD, and SKYBOX all have strong associations with sports.

Now I need to analyze the remaining 12 words:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; FUJIFILM
&bull; SCOREBOARD
&bull; POLAROID
&bull; KISSCAM
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; HASSELBLAD
&bull; CREAMSICLE
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; OLYMPUS
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; SKYBOX

Let me identify the remaining strong patterns:

1. <b>Camera brands</b>: FUJIFILM, HASSELBLAD, OLYMPUS, POLAROID - These are all well-known camera/photography companies.

2. <b>Trademarked/genericized brands</b>: ASTROTURF, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, CREAMSICLE - All were originally trademarked brand names.

3. <b>Sports-related</b>: JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX - These all have strong sports associations.

Let me think about these groups more carefully:

<b>Camera group</b>: FUJIFILM, HASSELBLAD, OLYMPUS, POLAROID - This is extremely strong. All four are major camera/photography companies. This is my best option for the next guess.

<b>Trademark/generic group</b>: ASTROTURF (synthetic grass), JUMBOTRON (large screen), KISSCAM (stadium camera), CREAMSICLE (ice cream treat) - This is also a very strong pattern. All four started as trademarked brand names.

<b>Sports group</b>: This one is slightly more tenuous. JOURNEYMAN (can refer to an athlete), RUSHMORE (Mount Rushmore - used for top players), SCOREBOARD (obviously sports), SKYBOX (stadium luxury seating). This is still a valid connection but maybe less direct than the other two.

The camera brand group seems slightly more iconic and well-known, so I'll go with that as the second guess.

&lt;guess&gt;
FUJIFILM, HASSELBLAD, OLYMPUS, POLAROID
&lt;/guess&gt;

&bull; SKYBOX

I can see two clear patterns:

1. <b>Trademarked/genericized brands</b>: ASTROTURF, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, CREAMSICLE - All four started as trademarked brand names that became genericized terms.

2. <b>Sports-related terms</b>: JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX - All four have strong connections to sports:
   - JOURNEYMAN: A professional athlete who plays for many teams
   - RUSHMORE: "Mount Rushmore" of a sport (top 4 players)
   - SCOREBOARD: Displays scores in athletic competitions
   - SKYBOX: Private luxury seating in stadiums

Both are very clean groups, but I'll go with the sports group since I think the Rushmore/Journeyman connection is clever and might be slightly less obvious.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The remaining words are:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; SCOREBOARD
&bull; KISSCAM
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; SKYBOX

My sports group (JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX) was incorrect. My trademarked/generic group (ASTROTURF, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, CREAMSICLE) was also incorrect.

Let me re-examine these words more carefully:

<b>ASTROTURF</b> - brand name for artificial grass
<b>JUMBOTRON</b> - brand name for large stadium screens
<b>KISSCAM</b> - brand name for stadium camera
<b>CREAMSICLE</b> - brand name for ice cream treat

That's a very clean pattern of brand names that became generic. Why would it be wrong?

Maybe the grouping is slightly different. Let me reconsider:

Could KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX, and SCOREBOARD go together as STADIUM FEATURES? 
&bull; KISSCAM: stadium camera feature
&bull; JUMBOTRON: stadium screen
&bull; SKYBOX: stadium seating
&bull; SCOREBOARD: stadium display

That's a very strong group!

Then what about JOURNEYMAN and RUSHMORE? They could potentially go with... but I'm missing something.

Wait, let me reconsider the entire grid. What are the remaining words? I have:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; SCOREBOARD
&bull; KISSCAM
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; SKYBOX

Let me think of other patterns:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ... what else? "Man" words? Journeyman, Rushmore (no). 

Could there be a "-man" word group? No, I don't have FROZENMAN or something.

What about MOUNT RUSHMORE and... JOURNEYMAN? No obvious connection.

Wait, let me reconsider ASTROTURF and CREAMSICLE. Both end in "-ICLE" or "-TURF"? No.

Let me think about prefixes:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; SCOREBOARD
&bull; KISSCAM
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; SKYBOX

Hmm, what if it's: CAMERA/JOURNEYMAN/SCOREBOARD/SKYBOX? No, doesn't make sense.

Wait, could JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, and CREAMSICLE be something together? No, that seems random.

Let me think differently. What if the groups were:
1. STADIUM FEATURES: KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX, SCOREBOARD
2. BRAND NAMES: ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE
3. And then JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE need two more?

But that doesn't work with the 4x4 format.

Let me reconsider the sports group. I said JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX.
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: sports term (journeyman athlete)
&bull; RUSHMORE: sports term ("Mount Rushmore" of sports)
&bull; SCOREBOARD: sports equipment
&bull; SKYBOX: stadium feature

Maybe the issue is RUSHMORE. While it's a metaphor used in sports, it's more directly a monument. Maybe RUSHMORE doesn't belong in this group.

What if the group is: JOURNEYMAN, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX, and then something else?

Wait, what about KISSCAM? That's also a stadium feature like SKYBOX and SCOREBOARD.

Let me think about the remaining words in pairs:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN + RUSHMORE: both compound words, both have "man" and "more"? No.
&bull; ASTROTURF + CREAMSICLE: both brand names that became generic

Is it possible that the trademarked group is correct, but I'm just missing something subtle that makes it not work?

Alternatively, what if the groups are:
1. ENDING IN "CAM": KISSCAM, ... only one
2. ENDING IN "TRON": JUMBOTRON, ... only one

Let me think about MOUNT RUSHMORE. "MOUNT" could pair with... what? MOUNT OLYMPUS? Wait, OLYMPUS already used.

Could JOURNEYMAN and RUSHMORE be part of a "COMPOUND NOUNS" group? That would be too broad.

Wait! What about ASTROTURF and CREAMSICLE? Both are brand names that became generic. But what about POLAROID? No, that was in the camera group.

Let me reconsider my camera group. Was FUJIFILM, HASSELBLAD, OLYMPUS, POLAROID definitely correct? The user said "CORRECT" so yes.

So remaining words need to form two groups of four:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; SCOREBOARD
&bull; KISSCAM
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; SKYBOX

Let me think about STADIUM/ARENA features:
&bull; KISSCAM: yes
&bull; JUMBOTRON: yes
&bull; SKYBOX: yes
&bull; SCOREBOARD: yes

That's a perfect group of 4! All are features found in stadiums/arenas.

So what's the other group?
It must be: JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE

What do these four have in common?
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: a word
&bull; RUSHMORE: a word (Mount Rushmore)
&bull; ASTROTURF: a word (artificial grass)
&bull; CREAMSICLE: a word (ice cream)

They could all be... what? They're all... no, SCOREBOARD is also a word.

Wait, maybe they're all TRADEMARKED BRAND NAMES that became genericized? 
&bull; ASTROTURF: Yes
&bull; CREAMSICLE: Yes
&bull; JUMBOTRON: Yes
&bull; KISSCAM: Yes

But I tried that group and it was wrong.

So KISSCAM and JUMBOTRON must go with SCOREBOARD and SKYBOX as stadium features.

That leaves:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE

What could these four possibly share? 

Think! What is JOURNEYMAN? It's a skilled worker who has completed an apprenticeship. It's a LEVEL OF MASTERY.

What is RUSHMORE? It's a mountain/monument. But could it be a LEVEL? Like "Mount Rushmore" means top level? 

What about ASTROTURF and CREAMSICLE? They're both brand names...

Wait, could the group be: JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE as "_____"? 

Let me think about suffixes:
&bull; -man
&bull; -more  
&bull; -turf
&bull; -sicle

No pattern.

What about prefixes?
&bull; Journey-
&bull; Rush-
&bull; Astro-
&bull; Cream-

No pattern.

Let me think about the words differently:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: contains "JOURNEY"
&bull; RUSHMORE: contains "RUSH"
&bull; ASTROTURF: contains "TURF"
&bull; CREAMSICLE: contains "CREAM"

Could these all be types of SOMETHING? Journeyman, Rushmore, Astro-Turf, Creamsicle?

Wait! What about JOURNEY and RUSH? Both are rock bands! Journey and Rush.
What about MOUNT RUSHMORE and MOUNT OLYMPUS? No, OLYMPUS is already used.

But if I'm thinking about MUSIC:
&bull; Journey: band
&bull; Rush: band

And then...? Astro? No band called Astro.
Cream: band (band from 1960s)

So JOURNEY (from JOURNEYMAN), RUSH (from RUSHMORE), CREAM (from CREAMSICLE)... and what's the fourth?

Is there a band related to ASTROTURF? Or is ASTROTURF not in this group?

Wait, let me reconsider. Maybe the group is:
&bull; TRADEMARKED BRANDS THAT BECAME GENERIC: ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM

But I tried that and it was wrong. So maybe two of these belong elsewhere.

Let me try the stadium group:
&bull; KISSCAM: stadium feature
&bull; JUMBOTRON: stadium feature
&bull; SKYBOX: stadium feature
&bull; SCOREBOARD: stadium feature

That's a perfect group. I'll try this.

Then the remaining four are:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE

What connects these four? 
&bull; They're all compound words
&bull; They all have specific meanings
&bull; They could all be... proper nouns? Not all.

Wait, could they all be things that can be preceded by a word? Like "MAN"? JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE MAN? No.

Could they all be things that have to do with LEVELS or TIERS?
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: level of skilled worker (between apprentice and master)
&bull; RUSHMORE: top tier (Mount Rushmore)
&bull; ASTROTURF: no
&bull; CREAMSICLE: no

What about being RELATED TO THINGS THAT ARE ARTIFICIAL or IMITATIONS?
&bull; ASTROTURF: artificial grass
&bull; CREAMSICLE: artificial? No, it's a real ice cream product

Wait, could RUSHMORE and JOURNEYMAN both be types of... no.

Let me try a different approach. What if ASTROTURF and CREAMSICLE are indeed the brands group, but I paired them wrong?

TRADEMARKED BRANDS: ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE, ______, ______

What about JOURNEYMAN? No, that's a general term.
What about RUSHMORE? No.
What about SCOREBOARD? That's a generic term.

Wait... SCOREBOARD could be a brand name? No.

Let me think about KISSCAM and JUMBOTRON again. These are definitely brand names.

So maybe: ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE, KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON are all TRADEMARKED TERMS.

But I already tried something like that and it was marked INCORRECT. Unless... maybe I need to be more specific? Like "BRAND NAMES THAT ARE NOW GENERICIZED"?

Actually, let me think about the categories differently. The categories in Connections are often more clever than just "camera brands" or "Italian cities."

What if the group is:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; SCOREBOARD
&bull; SKYBOX
&bull; RUSHMORE

And it's something like "_____ OF SPORTS"? But that seems too vague.

Or what if it's:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE

And it's "_____ THAT CONTAIN A WORD"? Like "JOURNEY", "RUSH", "TURF", "CREAM"? But that seems too meta.

Think! What is JOURNEYMAN? It's a term for a skilled worker.
What is RUSHMORE? It's a monument.
What is ASTROTURF? It's artificial grass.
What is CREAMSICLE? It's a frozen dessert.

Could they all be... THINGS THAT CONTAIN COLORS? No.
Could they all be... PROPER NOUNS? No.

Wait! What about ASTROTURF and CREAMSICLE both being BRANDS that SONY or some other company owns? No.

Let me think about the suffixes again:
&bull; -man (JOURNEYMAN)
&bull; -more (RUSHMORE)
&bull; -turf (ASTROTURF)
&bull; -sicle (CREAMSICLE)

Could these be... words that end in a way that sounds like something? No.

Could they be... words that can follow another word?
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: "hockey journeyman", "basketball journeyman"
&bull; RUSHMORE: "Mount Rushmore"
&bull; ASTROTURF: "political astroturf"
&bull; CREAMSICLE: "orange creamsicle"

No clear pattern.

Wait, what about them all being... THINGS THAT ARE FAKE or ARTIFICIAL?
&bull; ASTROTURF: fake grass
&bull; CREAMSICLE: artificial flavor? No, that's a stretch
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: not fake
&bull; RUSHMORE: not fake

I'm stuck. Let me reconsider everything.

What if the stadium group is actually WRONG? What else could KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX, and SCOREBOARD be?

&bull; KISSCAM: brand name
&bull; JUMBOTRON: brand name
&bull; SKYBOX: brand name?
&bull; SCOREBOARD: generic term

No, that doesn't work.

What if KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, CREAMSICLE, and ASTROTURF are the brand names group?

Then what's left:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; SCOREBOARD
&bull; SKYBOX

And these four must have a connection. What could it be?

&bull; "MOUNT" RUSHMORE
&bull; "BOX" SCORE? No, that doesn't make sense
&bull; "MAN" JOURNEY? No

Could it be that they all relate to... DIFFICULTY LEVELS? No.

Could they be... PARTS OF SPEECH? They're all nouns. Too broad.

Could they be... COMPOUND WORDS? Yes, but so are many others.

Wait! What if the connection is that they are all words that can be preceded by "SKY"?
&bull; SKY JOURNEY? No.
&bull; SKY RUSHMORE? No.
&bull; SKY SCOREBOARD? No.
&bull; SKY BOX: Yes!

That's not it.

What if the connection is that they are all words that can FOLLOW a word?
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: "hockey journeyman"
&bull; RUSHMORE: "Mount Rushmore"
&bull; SCOREBOARD: "hockey scoreboard"
&bull; SKYBOX: "hockey skybox"

They all work with "HOCKEY"! But that's too specific to one sport.

Wait, what about SPORTS in general? They all relate to sports:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: journeyman athlete
&bull; RUSHMORE: "Mount Rushmore" of sports (top 4)
&bull; SCOREBOARD: shows the score in sports
&bull; SKYBOX: seating at sporting events

But I tried that group and got INCORRECT! So RUSHMORE must not fit.

If RUSHMORE doesn't fit with JOURNEYMAN, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX, then where does it go?

RUSHMORE could go with... what? 

Could RUSHMORE, JOURNEYMAN, ASTROTURF, and CREAMSICLE be something like... "THINGS THAT CONTAIN WORDS THAT ARE ALSO BAND NAMES"?
&bull; JOURNEY: band
&bull; RUSH: band
&bull; CREEM? CREEM was a magazine. CREAM (from CREAMSICLE): band
&bull; ASTRO: no band

No, that's not quite right.

But wait - JOURNEY, RUSH, and CREAM are definitely band names! That's three. What's the fourth?

Is there a band called TURF? No.
Is there a band called ASTRO? Not relevant.

What if it's not about bands but about the words inside?
&bull; JOURNEYMAN contains "JOURNEY"
&bull; RUSHMORE contains "RUSH"
&bull; CREAMSICLE contains "CREAM"
&bull; ASTROTURF contains "TURF" (and "ASTRO")

Journey, Rush, Cream are all bands. Turf is not a famous band.

But "Astro" is a prefix... wait, "The Astro" no.

Let me think differently. What about... THINGS THAT ARE FAKE?
&bull; ASTROTURF: fake grass
&bull; ASTROTURFING: fake grassroots movement
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: not fake
&bull; RUSHMORE: not fake
&bull; CREAMSICLE: not fake

No.

What about... WORDS THAT CAN BE VERBS?
&bull; JOURNEY: yes
&bull; RUSH: yes
&bull; TURF: yes (as in "turf someone out")
&bull; CREAM: yes (to cream someone)

So JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE all contain verbs!

That's a very clever pattern! Let me verify:
&bull; JOURNEY (man) - journey is a verb
&bull; RUSH (more) - rush is a verb
&bull; TURF (astro) - turf can be a verb
&bull; CREAM (sicle) - cream can be a verb

But is TURF really used as a verb? Yes! "To turf" means to throw out or cover with turf.

And CREAM as a verb means to defeat badly.

This seems like a very valid connection. These four words contain verbs.

So then the other group would be:
&bull; SCOREBOARD
&bull; KISSCAM
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; SKYBOX

And these four would be STADIUM FEATURES (as I thought earlier).

Let me try that.

Actually wait, let me reconsider the verb group. Is "turf" common enough as a verb? Maybe not in American English. And "cream" as a verb might be too slangy.

Let me think of another possibility.

Could the group be:
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; SCOREBOARD
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; SKYBOX

And it's something like "THINGS WITH A SCORE/MORE/SCREEN/BOX"? No.

Wait, what about... "THINGS THAT DISPLAY SOMETHING"?
&bull; SCOREBOARD displays scores
&bull; JUMBOTRON displays video
&bull; SKYBOX displays (no)
&bull; KISSCAM displays people

RUSHMORE displays faces! That's it!

So: RUSHMORE, SCOREBOARD, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM all DISPLAY THINGS!

Then what's left:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE
&bull; SKYBOX

SKYBOX doesn't fit with displaying things. Let me reconsider.

If RUSHMORE, SCOREBOARD, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM are DISPLAY/DIGITAL/SCREEN group:

Then JOURNEYMAN, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE, and SKYBOX must be the last group.

What connects those four?
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: contains JOURNEY
&bull; ASTROTURF: contains TURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE: contains CREAM
&bull; SKYBOX: contains BOX

JOURNEY, TURF, CREAM, BOX... these are all common nouns that can standalone.

But so can SCORE, MORE, CAM, TRON...

Hmm, what about: JOURNEYMAN, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE are all BRAND NAMES OR TRADEMARKS?

Wait, ASTROTURF is a trademark. CREAMSICLE is a trademark. JUMBOTRON is a trademark. KISSCAM might be a trademark.

But I tried that and got it wrong! Unless I misidentified one.

Let me check: Is KISSCAM trademarked? Yes, it's a registered trademark.
Is CREAMSICLE trademarked? Yes, by Unilever.
Is ASTROTURF trademarked? Yes, originally by Monsanto.
Is JUMBOTRON trademarked? Yes, by Sony.

So why was ASTROTURF, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, CREAMSICLE marked incorrect?

Maybe KISSCAM doesn't belong in that group. Maybe KISSCAM is part of a different group.

What if KISSCAM goes with SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX, and JUMBOTRON as stadium features?

Then the last four are: JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE

And these must have a connection. What is it?

Let me think about levels/tiers:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: skill level
&bull; RUSHMORE: top tier (Mount Rushmore)
&bull; ASTROTURF: surface level? No.
&bull; CREAMSICLE: quality level? No.

What about... they all contain words that start with letters... no.

Could it be... they are all COMPOUND WORDS where the first part modifies the second?
&bull; JOURNEY-MAN: man of journey? No.
&bull; RUSH-MORE: more rush? No.
&bull; ASTRO-TURF: turf for stars? Yes.
&bull; CREAM-SICLE: sicle of cream? No.

What about... they all contain a WORD + SUFFIX?
&bull; JOURNEY + MAN
&bull; RUSH + MORE
&bull; ASTRO + TURF
&bull; CREAM + SICLE

MAN, MORE, TURF, SICLE... no connection.

But wait... JOURNEY, RUSH, ASTRO, CREAM...

JOURNEY and RUSH are both rock bands!
CREAM is a rock band!
ASTRO could be Astro (British band) or A.S.T.R.O... but that's not as famous.

But what if it's not about bands? What if it's about... FAMOUS ROCK BANDS?
&bull; JOURNEY: huge American rock band
&bull; RUSH: huge Canadian rock band  
&bull; CREAM: huge British rock band
&bull; ??? What about ASTRO? Or is it about the word TURF?

No, that doesn't quite work.

Wait, what about... WORDS THAT CONTAIN A WORD THAT IS ALSO A PROPER NOUN?
&bull; JOURNEYMAN contains JOURNEY (band, movie)
&bull; RUSHMORE contains RUSH (band) and MORE (band? no)
&bull; ASTROTURF contains ASTRO (many things) and TURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE contains CREAM (band)

This is getting too complicated.

Let me step back. I've tried:
1. Italian demonyms - CORRECT
2. Camera brands - CORRECT
3. Sports terms (Journeyman, Rushmore, Scoreboard, Skybox) - INCORRECT
4. Brand names (AstroTurf, Jumbotron, KIsscam, Creamsicle) - INCORRECT

So the remaining groups are NOT those.

With 8 words left, there must be two groups of four.

Let me list them again:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; SCOREBOARD
&bull; KISSCAM
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; SKYBOX

Let me think about SPORTS VIEWING:
&bull; SKYBOX: premium seating at sports events
&bull; SCOREBOARD: shows scores at sports events
&bull; KISSCAM: entertainment at sports events
&bull; JUMBOTRON: shows replays at sports events

This is a PERFECT group of 4! They are all features/enhancements for SPORTS SPECTATORS.

Then the other four must be:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE

What connects THESE four?

Let me think... they all contain words that are also... COMMON NOUNS:
&bull; JOURNEY (man)
&bull; RUSH (more)
&bull; TURF (astro) - but turf is first
&bull; CREAM (sicle)

But that's too vague.

Wait! What about... they are all COMPOUND WORDS where one part is a type of MOVEMENT?
&bull; JOURNEY: yes
&bull; RUSH: yes
&bull; TURF: no
&bull; CREAM: no

No.

What about... they are all words that CAN BE VERBS:
&bull; JOURNEY: yes
&bull; RUSH: yes
&bull; TURF: yes (to turf someone out)
&bull; CREAM: yes (to defeat badly)

So JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, and CREAMSICLE all contain verbs!

This is a very clever category. Let me verify:
&bull; JOURNEY (in JOURNEYMAN) - definitely a verb
&bull; RUSH (in RUSHMORE) - definitely a verb
&bull; TURF (in ASTROTURF) - yes, can be a verb meaning to cover with turf or eject
&bull; CREAM (in CREAMSICLE) - yes, slang verb meaning to defeat

The category would be something like "WORDS THAT CONTAIN A VERB".

This seems like a very plausible NYT Connections category. It's clever and not too obvious.

Let me try this grouping:
GROUP A (Sports Spectator Features): SCOREBOARD, KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX
GROUP B (Words Containing Verbs): JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE

I feel good about this. The sports spectator group is very clean. The verb group is clever but logical.

I'll try the sports group first since it's more straightforward.

&lt;guess&gt;
SCOREBOARD, KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX
&lt;/guess&gt;

&lt;confidence&gt;
0.88

That means I must get the next guess correct or I lose.

Let me analyze what went wrong. I have 4 words left that I haven't tried grouping together yet:

After my previous attempts, I have:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE

These four must form the final category, since all my other attempts to group them with other words have failed.

What connects these four words?

Let me think more carefully about each:
1. <b>JOURNEYMAN</b> - contains "JOURNEY"
2. <b>RUSHMORE</b> - contains "RUSH"
3. <b>ASTROTURF</b> - contains "TURF" (and "ASTRO")
4. <b>CREAMSICLE</b> - contains "CREAM"

I previously thought about the verb connection, but let me reconsider.

Actually, wait. Let me think about brand names again.
&bull; ASTROTURF is a trademarked brand name
&bull; CREAMSICLE is a trademarked brand name
&bull; JOURNEYMAN is a general term
&bull; RUSHMORE is a proper noun (mountain)

What about rock bands?
&bull; JOURNEY: huge American rock band
&bull; RUSH: huge Canadian rock band
&bull; CREAM: huge British rock band

And what's left? ASTROTURF... which contains "ASTRO". Could that refer to "Astro"? There are bands named Astro, but they're not as iconic.

But wait - what if it's not about bands, but about the words themselves?

<b>JOURNEY</b>, <b>RUSH</b>, <b>CREAM</b> are all words that can be common nouns AND verbs.

And <b>TURF</b> is also a noun and a verb!

So the connection is: WORDS THAT CAN BE BOTH NOUNS AND VERBS.

Let me verify:
&bull; JOURNEY: noun (a trip), verb (to travel)
&bull; RUSH: noun (a hurry), verb (to hurry)
&bull; TURF: noun (grass), verb (to cover with turf)
&bull; CREAM: noun (dairy product), verb (to beat badly)

This is a very solid connection! Much cleaner than my previous attempts.

So the category is likely "_____ THAT CONTAIN A WORD THAT FUNCTIONS AS BOTH A NOUN AND A VERB" or more simply "WORDS CONTAINING A NOUN/VERB HOMOGRAPH".

This must be the answer. I have to be confident since it's my last try.

Actually, wait. Let me double-check that ASTROTURF was truly not part of the sports spectator group. I tried SCOREBOARD, KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX and got it wrong.

So those four words (SCOREBOARD, KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX) are NOT a group.

But that doesn't make sense... they all seem so clearly related to stadiums/sports viewing.

Unless... one of them belongs to the JOURNEYMAN/RUSHMORE/ASTROTURF/CREAMSICLE group.

Which one could fit?
&bull; SCOREBOARD: contains "SCORE" (noun and verb!) - Yes!
&bull; KISSCAM: contains "KISS" (noun and verb!) - Yes!
&bull; JUMBOTRON: contains "TRON"? No. "JUMBO"? Jumbo is only a noun/adjective.
&bull; SKYBOX: contains "BOX" (noun and verb!) - Yes!

So my group could be: JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, SCOREBOARD, KISSCAM all contain noun/verb homographs!

Wait, but then what's left?
&bull; ASTROTURF (contains TURF - noun/verb)
&bull; CREAMSICLE (contains CREAM - noun/verb)
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; SKYBOX

These would have to form the last group. What connects JUMBOTRON and SKYBOX? They both contain words that are... nouns only? "TRON" and "JUMBO" and "SKY"?

Actually, "BOX" is a noun and a verb! But I would have used SKYBOX in the noun/verb group if that's the case.

Let me reconsider the entire set of remaining words:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN
&bull; SCOREBOARD
&bull; KISSCAM
&bull; ASTROTURF
&bull; CREAMSICLE
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; RUSHMORE
&bull; SKYBOX

What if the noun/verb homograph group is:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN (JOURNEY)
&bull; RUSHMORE (RUSH)
&bull; SCOREBOARD (SCORE)
&bull; KISSCAM (KISS)

All contain words that are nouns and verbs!

Then the remaining four are:
&bull; ASTROTURF (TURF)
&bull; CREAMSICLE (CREAM)
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; SKYBOX (BOX)

Wait, but TURF and BOX are also nouns and verbs! So this grouping doesn't work.

I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to basics.

I have 4 words left: JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE

I need to find ONE connection that unites all four. Since every other attempt to split them has failed, they must go together.

What is a connection that fits all four?
&bull; They're all compound words: Yes
&bull; They all contain trademarked terms: ASTROTURF and CREAMSICLE are trademarks, but JOURNEYMAN and RUSHMORE are not.

Wait, could the connection be something like "_____ THAT SOUND LIKE THEY COULD BE TRADEMARKS"? No, that's too vague.

Let me think about the first parts:
&bull; JOURNEY-
&bull; RUSH-
&bull; ASTRO-
&bull; CREAM-

JOURNEY and RUSH are both rock bands.
CREAM is also a rock band.
ASTRO is... not a major rock band, but there are bands named Astro.

Could the category be "WORDS THAT CONTAIN THE NAME OF A ROCK BAND"?

That's a NYT-style connection! It's clever and specific.

Let me verify:
&bull; <b>JOURNEYMAN</b>: contains JOURNEY (the band)
&bull; <b>RUSHMORE</b>: contains RUSH (the band)
&bull; <b>ASTROTURF</b>: contains ASTRO? There are bands named Astro but they're not as famous.
&bull; <b>CREAMSICLE</b>: contains CREAM (the band)

Hmm, the Astro connection is weak.

Wait, what if it's "WORDS THAT CONTAIN WORDS THAT ARE ALSO ROCK BANDS OR USED IN MUSIC"?

No, that's getting too complicated.

Let me think about another angle. What if these are all FAMOUS AMERICAN BRANDS OR PRODUCTS?

&bull; JOURNEYMAN: no, it's a general term
&bull; RUSHMORE: no, it's a mountain
&bull; ASTROTURF: yes (brand)
&bull; CREAMSICLE: yes (brand)

No, that doesn't work.

What about... they are all words that can be preceded by "POLITICAL"?
&bull; Political journeyman? No.
&bull; Political Rushmore? No.
&bull; Political astroturf? Yes! Astroturfing refers to fake political movements.
&bull; Political creamsicle? No.

Only one works.

What about... they are all words that can be followed by "MAN"?
&bull; Journeyman man? No.

I'm going in circles. Let me think about the simplest possible connection.

All four are compound words. That is true of many words in the puzzle.

All four have a stress pattern: DUM-da-da? JOUR-ney-man, RUSH-more, AS-tro-turf, CREAM-si-cle.

No, that doesn't help.

Let me think about the etymology:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: from French "journée" (day)
&bull; RUSHMORE: from "rush" + "more" (a hill)
&bull; ASTROTURF: "astro-" (star/space) + "turf"
&bull; CREAMSICLE: "cream" + "sicle" (from popsicle)

The only connection I see is that they all contain words that are also common English words by themselves: JOURNEY, RUSH, TURF, CREAM.

And those four words (journey, rush, turf, cream) are all... what? 
&bull; They can all be verbs: Yes!
&bull; They can all be nouns: Yes!

That's the connection! WORDS CONTAINING A NOUN/VERB HOMOGRAPH.

Even though ASTROTURF has "turf" and CREAMSICLE has "cream" which are also nouns/verbs, I think the groups are:

GROUP 1: JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE (Words containing a noun/verb)
GROUP 2: SCOREBOARD, KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX (Stadium features)

But I tried the stadium features and it was wrong. So the stadium features group must be different.

Let me try one more time with noun/verb group:
&bull; JOURNEYMAN (journey)
&bull; RUSHMORE (rush)
&bull; SCOREBOARD (score)
&bull; KISSCAM (kiss)

That's a clean group of four words that contain noun/verb homographs.

Then the other four would be:
&bull; ASTROTURF (turf)
&bull; CREAMSICLE (cream)
&bull; JUMBOTRON
&bull; SKYBOX (box)

What connects these four? They all contain words that could be... part of the previous group too! TURF, CREAM, and BOX are also noun/verbs.

I'm confused. Let me try a completely different approach.

What if the connection is about COLORS?
&bull; JOURNEYMAN: no color
&bull; RUSHMORE: no color (though mountains can be described as gray)
&bull; ASTROTURF: green
&bull; CREAMSICLE: orange and white

No clear pattern.

What about... LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY?
&bull; Journeyman: medium difficulty
&bull; Rushmore: very difficult (imposing)
&bull; Astroturf: easy to maintain
&bull; Creamsicle: easy to eat

No, that's not a real category.

OK, final attempt. I need to be confident and just go with the most logical connection.

The four remaining words are: JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE

The most logical connection is: THEY ARE ALL COMPOUND WORDS THAT CONTAIN A WORD THAT CAN BE BOTH A NOUN AND A VERB.

Even if other words like SCOREBOARD also fit this pattern, these four were purposely grouped together by the puzzle designers.

I need to commit to this answer. It's my last guess.

&lt;guess&gt;
JOURNEYMAN, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE

Now I have 12 words left: RANK, SCORE, DYE, GRADE, STOCKINGS, PACE, RATE, BLUSH, MASCARA, NOSE, FIDGET, SWEAT

Let me identify the clearest connections:

1. <b>Assessment/Measurement</b>: RANK, SCORE, RATE, and GRADE are all verbs/nouns that mean to evaluate or assign a value to something. This is a very strong, classic Connections group.

2. <b>Beauty/Fashion</b>: BLUSH, MASCARA, STOCKINGS, and DYE are all items used for appearance (makeup, hair coloring, clothing).

3. <b>Stress/Anxiety responses</b>: The remaining four - NOSE (as in runny nose when stressed), FIDGET, PACE, and SWEAT are all physical manifestations of nervousness or stress.

The assessment group is the most straightforward and least ambiguous, so I'll guess that next.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;RANK, SCORE, RATE, GRADE&lt;/guess&gt;

Looking at the remaining words, I can see two clear potential groups:

1. <b>Beauty/Fashion items</b>: BLUSH (makeup), MASCARA (makeup), DYE (hair dye), STOCKINGS (clothing accessory). These are all tangible items used for personal appearance.

2. <b>Stress/Anxiety responses</b>: NOSE (runny nose when nervous), FIDGET (nervous behavior), PACE (walking nervously), SWEAT (physical stress response). These are all physical manifestations of nervousness.

Both groups are very strong, but the beauty/fashion group seems more concrete and less ambiguous. Let me go with that one next.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;BLUSH, DYE, MASCARA, STOCKINGS&lt;/guess&gt;

My previous guess (BLUSH, DYE, MASCARA, STOCKINGS) was incorrect, so I need to reconsider.

The stress/anxiety group remains very compelling: NOSE (runny nose when nervous), FIDGET (nervous behavior), PACE (anxious walking), SWEAT (stress response). These are all physical manifestations of nervousness.

If this group is correct, then the remaining four (BLUSH, DYE, MASCARA, STOCKINGS) must have a different connection than I thought. Let me think about what I might have missed...

Wait - could these all be things that can be preceded by "body"? Body blush? No. Body dye? No.

Could they be things related to "color"? Blush has color, dye adds color, mascara has color, stockings come in colors - but that's too vague.

Let me reconsider: What if there's a more specific beauty connection? 
&bull; BLUSH: makeup product
&bull; MASCARA: makeup product  
&bull; DYE: hair dye (beauty product)
&bull; STOCKINGS: fashion item

Actually, this still seems like a valid "beauty/fashion" category despite being marked wrong. But I need to trust the game feedback.

Alternative grouping: Could "stockings" go with something else? 
&bull; Christmas stockings? No other Christmas words.

Let me try the stress/anxiety group first since it's the clearest remaining pattern, and then I'll have more information about the final four words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;NOSE, FIDGET, PACE, SWEAT&lt;/guess&gt;

Two incorrect guesses so far:
1. BLUSH, DYE, MASCARA, STOCKINGS (beauty/fashion group)
2. NOSE, FIDGET, PACE, SWEAT (stress/anxiety group)

Both were wrong, so I need a different approach. Let me look for a new pattern.

Looking at all 8 words again:
&bull; BLUSH
&bull; DYE
&bull; FIDGET
&bull; PACE
&bull; MASCARA
&bull; NOSE
&bull; STOCKINGS
&bull; SWEAT

New observation: BLUSH, DYE, FIDGET, and PACE can all be <b>verbs</b> (you can blush, dye something, fidget, pace back and forth).

If that's correct, the remaining four would be: NOSE, MASCARA, STOCKINGS, SWEAT

What connects these four?
Thinking about the word "run":
&bull; Runny nose ✓
&bull; Running mascara ✓ (when it smudges)
&bull; Run in stockings ✓ (a tear/ladder)
&bull; Sweat runs down your face ✓ (common phrasing)

Perfect! Both groups are strong:
<b>Group 1:</b> BLUSH, DYE, FIDGET, PACE (verbs)
<b>Group 2:</b> NOSE, MASCARA, STOCKINGS, SWEAT (connected by "run")

I'll guess the verb group first.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;BLUSH, DYE, FIDGET, PACE&lt;/guess&gt;

Let me reconsider all my previous failed guesses:
1. BLUSH, DYE, MASCARA, STOCKINGS (beauty/fashion)
2. NOSE, FIDGET, PACE, SWEAT (stress/anxiety responses)
3. BLUSH, DYE, FIDGET, PACE (verbs)

What's left? I need to think differently.

<b>Key insight - the "run" connection:</b>
&bull; Running mascara ✓
&bull; Run in stockings ✓ (a ladder is called a "run")
&bull; Runny nose ✓
&bull; Sweat runs (down your face) ✓

I NEVER guessed this specific combination! This is the most coherent pattern left.

If this group is correct, the remaining four (BLUSH, DYE, FIDGET, PACE) must be verbs - which makes perfect sense:
&bull; to blush
&bull; to dye something
&bull; to fidget
&bull; to pace (back and forth)

1. <b>Cooking verbs</b>: WHISK, BEAT, WHIP, and CREAM are all terms used in the kitchen. Whisk, beat, and whip are mixing actions, and "cream" is also a verb meaning to work butter and sugar into a creamy paste.

2. <b>Light descriptors</b>: DIM, FAINT, PALE, and LIGHT all relate to brightness levels or lack of intensity.

3. <b>Bear types</b>: POLAR, BROWN, BLACK, and BLONDE (blonde bears are light-colored grizzlies) are all prefixes for "bear."

4. <b>Compound words</b>: BROWN + RICE (brown rice), SUN + LIGHT (sunlight) could form pairs.

The cooking verb category is the strongest because:
&bull; WHISK, BEAT, WHIP are unambiguously kitchen actions
&bull; CREAM as a verb is standard baking terminology ("cream the butter")
&bull; These four form a clean, distinct category with no overlap issues
&bull; It's a common knowledge domain accessible to most solvers

The light descriptors is also strong, but "LIGHT" could be ambiguous as it's also a noun and opposite of "heavy."

The bear types category is weaker because "blonde bear" is less common terminology.

I'll go with the cooking verb category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The previous cooking verbs category (WHISK, BEAT, WHIP, CREAM) was correct.

Available words: BLACK, BLONDE, BROWN, DIM, FAINT, LIGHT, PALE, POLAR, POOL, RICE, SUN, WORD

Looking at these, I can identify several potential categories:

1. <b>Light intensity descriptors</b>: DIM, FAINT, PALE, LIGHT - these all relate to brightness or lack of intensity

2. <b>Bear types</b>: POLAR, BROWN, BLACK, BLONDE - all are prefixes for "bear" (polar bear, brown bear, black bear, and blonde bear which is a real term for light-colored grizzly bears)

3. <b>Other potential pairs</b>: SUN LIGHT, POOL LIGHT, etc.

The strongest category is clearly the light descriptors: DIM, FAINT, PALE, and LIGHT. These are all adjectives that describe reduced visibility or brightness levels. They form a clean, unambiguous category.

The bear category is also possible, but "blonde bear" is much less commonly known than the other three, making it slightly weaker.

I'll go with the light descriptor category as it's more straightforward and likely the intended grouping.</div></details><div>The system prompts the user to make a valid guess by providing exactly four words from the available list. The user has made an error in their response format.

Now I need to analyze the remaining words:

1. <b>Bear types</b>: BLACK, BROWN, POLAR, and BLONDE are all prefixes for "bear." This is a strong, clear category:
   - Black bear (common)
   - Brown bear (common)
   - Polar bear (common)
   - Blonde bear (a real term for a light-colored grizzly bear)

2. <b>Other potential connections</b>:
   - SUN + ??? (but I don't have "light," "rise," or "set" available)
   - POOL + WORD don't seem to connect with others
   - RICE is orphaned

The bear category is clearly the intended group for these four words. "Blonde bear" is less common but still a legitimate wildlife term used by biologists to describe light-phase grizzly bears.

This seems like the most logical next guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

1. WHISK, BEAT, WHIP, CREAM (cooking verbs)
2. DIM, FAINT, PALE, LIGHT (light descriptors)

Available words: BLACK, BLONDE, BROWN, POLAR, POOL, RICE, SUN, WORD

I previously tried BLACK, BLONDE, BROWN, POLAR and got it wrong. Let me reconsider.

I think the issue was including BLONDE. The correct bear category is likely:
&bull; BLACK bear
&bull; BROWN bear  
&bull; POLAR bear
&bull; SUN bear (this is a real species!)

BLONDE bear isn't a distinct species - it's just a light-colored brown bear.

So BLACK, BROWN, POLAR, SUN are bear types.

That leaves: BLONDE, WORD, POOL, RICE

What could these four be? Let me think:
&bull; WORD POOL is a term (collection of words)
&bull; CROSSWORD contains WORD
&bull; CARPOOL contains POOL
&bull; RICE... maybe "rice bowl" or "rice paper"?

Actually, I see the connection now! These all form compound words with a preceding word:
&bull; CROSSWORD (word)
&bull; CARPOOL (pool)
&bull; RICE... maybe "rice bowl"? But "bowl" isn't here.

Wait, let me reconsider. What if these are all types of "___" that can follow another specific word? 

Actually, I just realized: BLONDE, WORD, POOL, RICE can all follow different words to form compounds, but they don't share a common preceding word. Let me think differently.

Could they be: 
&bull; Types of "ALE/BEER"? BLONDE ale, but WORD ale? No.
&bull; Types of "PAPER"? Rice paper, but word paper? No.

Hmm, I'm not 100% clear on the second group yet, but I'm confident about the bear group. Let me make that guess first.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

2. VANE, WIND CHIME, FLAG, PINWHEEL (wind-activated items)

Remaining words: KANGAROO, STREET, RAINBOW, NEIGHBORHOOD, SHOEHORN, WEDGE, JAM, STUFF

Now I need to find the next most obvious group. Looking at the remaining words:

SHOEHORN, WEDGE, JAM, STUFF - these are all verbs (and nouns) that mean to force or compress something into a tight space or container. This is a very strong semantic connection.

&bull; To shoehorn something = to force it into a tight space
&bull; To wedge something = to force it into a narrow space
&bull; To jam something = to force or wedge it into something
&bull; To stuff something = to force or pack material into something

This is a clear, unambiguous group with a strong thematic connection.

The final four words (KANGAROO, STREET, RAINBOW, NEIGHBORHOOD) must then form the last group. I should trust the puzzle structure - in NYT Connections, once you remove the clear groups, the remaining words always form a coherent category. Even if the connection isn't immediately obvious to me, it's guaranteed to exist based on the game design.

The pressure is on - this is my 3rd guess out of 6 allowed, so I need to be confident. The force/insert group is solid.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

2. "Sky" compounds: ROCKET, LARK, DIVE, SCRAPER
3. Sports team names: DUCK, FLYER, STAR, SENATOR
4. Bar/snack foods: DIP, FRY, WING, CHIP

Let me verify the "sky" compounds group:
&bull; Skyrocket (✓)
&bull; Skylark (✓)
&bull; Skydive (✓)
&bull; Skyscraper (✓)

This is a perfect group of four words that all form common terms when preceded by "sky".

Let me verify the sports team names group:
&bull; DUCK: Anaheim Ducks (NHL) (✓)
&bull; FLYER: Philadelphia Flyers (NHL) (✓)
&bull; STAR: Dallas Stars (NHL) (✓)
&bull; SENATOR: Ottawa Senators (NHL) (✓)

This is also a perfect group - all are NHL team names (though Senators could also refer to Washington Senators in MLB historically, but Ottawa Senators is current NHL).

Let me verify the bar/snack foods group:
&bull; DIP: bar food (✓)
&bull; FRY: bar food (✓)
&bull; WING: chicken wings, bar food (✓)
&bull; CHIP: bar food (✓)

This is also a valid group.

All three remaining groups are valid. I should choose the one I'm most confident about. The "sky" compounds group is very clear and unambiguous. The sports team group is also clear. The food group is perhaps slightly more subjective but still strong.

CALL, PETITION, DRIVER, NAME, EMAIL, FINLET, ADDRESS, EBAY, APPEAL, FLAKE, NUMBER, BID

I can identify two very strong categories:
1. Contact information fields: EMAIL, ADDRESS, NAME, NUMBER - these are the standard fields you fill out in forms
2. Formal requests/offers: PETITION, APPEAL, BID, CALL - these are all words for formal/solicitation requests in legal, commercial, or procedural contexts

This leaves: DRIVER, FINLET, EBAY, FLAKE which must be the final category. While the connection is less obvious, these could be words with specific jargon meanings in different fields (software, biology, e-commerce, software testing).

The most logical next guess is the contact information category as it's extremely clear and common in Connections puzzles.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me analyze the list:

FREEZE, SUB, HACK, COPPER, ALTERNATE, VAPORIZE, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, BACKUP, SUIT, MELT, SOMEDAY, CONDENSE, FANTASY, COVER

I can see several potential groupings:

1. <b>Phase transitions</b>: FREEZE, MELT, VAPORIZE, CONDENSE - these are all scientific terms describing changes in state of matter (solid↔liquid↔gas). This is a very strong, clean category.

2. <b>Substitutes/Alternatives</b>: SUB, ALTERNATE, BACKUP, COVER - these can all mean "replacement" or "stand-in" in various contexts.

3. <b>Other possibilities</b>: Looking for connections like "words that can follow 'life'" (LIFE HACK is the only clear one), slang terms (SHRINK for psychiatrist, HACK for writer), or genres (HERO, FANTASY).

The phase transition group is the most cohesive and parallel. All four words are verbs describing the exact same scientific concept - changes in a substance's state:
&bull; FREEZE: liquid to solid
&bull; MELT: solid to liquid  
&bull; VAPORIZE: liquid to gas
&bull; CONDENSE: gas to liquid

This forms a complete, logical set with no ambiguity. While the "substitutes" group is plausible, it's less precise because the words function differently (SUB is clipped, COVER requires a preposition, etc.).

The phase transition category is classic NYT Connections material - scientific, clear, and perfectly balanced.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
FREEZE, MELT, VAPORIZE, CONDENSE

NEXT GUESS?" which means my first guess was right. Now I need to find another group of four related words from the remaining words.

Remaining words: SUB, HACK, COPPER, ALTERNATE, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, BACKUP, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY, COVER

Let me analyze potential groupings:

1. <b>Substitutes/Alternatives</b>: SUB, BACKUP, ALTERNATE, COVER - these can all mean "replacement" or "stand-in". SUB (substitute), BACKUP (standby), ALTERNATE (another option), COVER (to substitute for someone). This seems like a strong group.

2. <b>Words with "___ story"</b>: 
   - HORROR story? No HORROR isn't here
   - HERO story? Yes
   - FANTASY story? Yes  
   - SOMEDAY? No
   - ALTERNATE story? Could work as "alternate history"
   - COPPER? No

3. <b>Compound words or phrases</b>:
   - HONEY + MOON? MOON isn't here
   - HACK + SAW? SAW isn't here
   - SUB + WAY? WAY isn't here
   - COPPER + HEAD? HEAD isn't here

4. <b>Slang terms</b>:
   - HACK (sloppy work/prison slang)
   - SHRINK (psychiatrist)
   - SUB (sandwich/substitute)
   - Not clear enough

5. <b>Colors or materials</b>: COPPER is a metal/color. HONEY is a color. These might be part of a color group, but I don't see two more clear color words.

6. <b>Words before "story" or "tale"</b>: 
   - HERO story ✓
   - FANTASY story ✓
   - ALTERNATE universe/story ✓
   - SOMEDAY (a story)? No

Wait, let me reconsider the "story" angle more carefully:
&bull; HERO story
&bull; FANTASY story  
&bull; ALTERNATE history/story
&bull; These could form a "types of fiction" group

But "SOMEDAY" doesn't fit that. Let me think about other story genres...

Actually, let me look at the "substitutes" group again:
&bull; SUB: short for substitute
&bull; BACKUP: standby replacement
&bull; ALTERNATE: another option, stand-in
&bull; COVER: to cover for someone, substitute

This is very clean. All four are synonyms for "replacement" in different contexts. This is likely the intended group.

Let me double-check other potential groupings to be sure:
&bull; HERO, FANTASY, SOMEDAY, ? - maybe these are "types of ___"? Not clear.
&bull; HACK, SUIT, SHRINK, ? - could be slang? HACK (writer), SHRINK (psychiatrist), COPPER (police officer in British slang), SUIT (businessperson). This is interesting but less common.

The "substitutes" group is the most cohesive and parallel in structure. All are nouns that can mean "replacement" or "stand-in":
&bull; SUB (noun: substitute/replacement)
&bull; BACKUP (noun: standby replacement)
&bull; ALTERNATE (noun: alternate choice)
&bull; COVER (noun: covering, person who covers for another)

I'll go with this group.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
SUB, BACKUP, ALTERNATE, COVER
&lt;/guess&gt;

Two groups down. Remaining words: HACK, COPPER, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

I need to find two more groups from these eight words.

Let me analyze:

1. <b>Compound words or phrases</b>:
   - HONEY + MOON? MOON isn't here
   - HERO + ? 
   - FANTASY + ?
   - HACK + ?

2. <b>Slang terms</b>:
   - HACK (to cheat, or a writer/journalist)
   - SHRINK (psychiatrist)  
   - COPPER? British slang for police officer
   - SUIT? Could mean a businessperson or executive
   - HONEY? Could be a term of endearment

3. <b>Colors</b>: 
   - HONEY (color)
   - COPPER (color)
   - Maybe FANTASY? No, not a color.

4. <b>Words that can precede "story" or "___ story"</b>:
   - HERO story ✓
   - FANTASY story ✓
   - HORROR story? No HORROR here
   - ALTERNATE? Already used
   - SOMEDAY? Could be "someday story"? Not clear.

5. <b>Words that can precede "____-story"</b>:
   - HERO? No
   - FANTASY? No
   - TWO-story? No

6. <b>Words that can follow "_____"</b>:
   - HONEY bee? BEE isn't here
   - COPPER penny? PENNY isn't here
   - HACK job? JOB isn't here

7. <b>Looking at the remaining words more carefully</b>:
   - HACK, COPPER, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY
   
Wait, I see something! Let me think about the "___ story" angle again:
&bull; HERO story ✓
&bull; FANTASY story ✓
&bull; HORROR story? No HORROR
&bull; COPPER? No
&bull; HACK? No
&bull; SOMEDAY? Not really

Actually, let me reconsider the "colors" angle:
&bull; HONEY (amber/gold color)
&bull; COPPER (brown/orange color)
&bull; These could be two colors

What could be the other two colors? Looking at the remaining words:
&bull; HERO? Not a color
&bull; SUIT? Could be "suit" but not really a color
&bull; SHRINK? No
&bull; SOMEDAY? No
&bull; FANTASY? No

Hmm, that doesn't work.

Let me think about the "slang" group again:
&bull; HACK (to cut, or a writer, or a taxi driver)
&bull; SHRINK (psychiatrist)  
&bull; SUIT (businessperson)
&bull; COPPER (police officer in British slang)

This could work! These are all slang terms for different professions/roles. But is it too obscure?

Alternative grouping:
&bull; HERO, FANTASY, SOMEDAY, ?
These could all relate to "dream" or "aspiration"...

Wait, let me think about "___-suit":
&bull; SUIT (lawsuit, bathing suit)
&bull; HACK? No
&bull; HERO? No
&bull; SHRINK? No

What about "___-story"? 
&bull; HERO story ✓
&bull; FANTASY story ✓
&bull; TWO-story? No
&bull; SHORT story? SHORT isn't here

Let me look at "___-story" again. Could be:
&bull; HERO story
&bull; FANTASY story
&bull; SHORT story (but SHORT isn't here)
&bull; GHOST story? GHOST isn't here

Wait, HONEY + story? No.
SOMEDAY + story? Could be a "someday story" but that's not a recognized genre.

Let me reconsider: maybe I'm overthinking. There could be a more obvious group:

HACK, SHRINK, SUIT, COPPER - all can be slang for professions
HACK = writer
SHRINK = psychiatrist
SUIT = businessperson/executive
COPPER = police officer (British slang)

This seems plausible but maybe too obscure for NYT Connections.

Let me look at the remaining words again:
HACK, COPPER, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

What about:
&bull; HERO, FANTASY - both are genres
&bull; HACK, SHRINK, SUIT, COPPER - all are professions in slang

That would give me two groups. Let me test if the slang group is strong enough.

Actually wait, I just realized something about "SOMEDAY". SOMEDAY + ?

SOMEDAY + ? = SOMEDAY soon? SOMEDAY soon? No.

Let me think differently. What about "___-suit"?
&bull; HERO + ? No
&bull; HACK + ? No
&bull; COPPER + ? No
&bull; SHRINK + ? No

What about compound words with "story"?
&bull; HERO story ✓
&bull; FANTASY story ✓
&bull; GHOST story? GHOST isn't here
&bull; LOVE story? LOVE isn't here
&bull; SHORT story? SHORT isn't here

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the remaining words more carefully.

HACK - could be "hacksaw", "hackney", "hack job"
COPPER - could be "copperhead", "copper penny"
HERO - could be "heroic", "heroism"
HONEY - could be "honeymoon", "honey bee"
SHRINK - could be "shrinkwrap", "headshrinker"
SUIT - could be "lawsuit", "bathing suit", "suit up"
SOMEDAY - compound word: some + day
FANTASY - could be "fantasyland"

Wait, HONEY + MOON = HONEYMOON, but MOON isn't here.
But what about SOMEDAY? SOMEDAY could be SOME + DAY.

Actually, I see something: HONEY + SOMEDAY? No.

Let me think about "types of ___":
&bull; HERO is a type of character
&bull; FANTASY is a type of genre
&bull; HONEY is a type of... color? Food?

Wait, could HONEY and COPPER be colors?
&bull; HONEY (amber)
&bull; COPPER (brown/orange)
&bull; What other colors? Looking at remaining words... 
&bull; SUIT? "Suit" doesn't seem like a color
&bull; HACK? No
&bull; SHRINK? No

Let me reconsider the slang group:
&bull; HACK = writer/journalist
&bull; SHRINK = psychiatrist 
&bull; SUIT = businessperson
&bull; COPPER = police officer

This is actually a very clean group. All are slang terms for professions. NYT Connections does use slang terms and wordplay. This seems like a viable group.

What would the remaining four be then?
HONEY, HERO, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

These could be: HONEY (color), ??? Not working.

Wait, what about HERO, FANTASY, SOMEDAY, and maybe something else? Let me check my remaining words again.

Actually, let me re-list all remaining words:
HACK, COPPER, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

Maybe there's a different grouping. Let me think about prefixes/suffixes:

&bull; HACK: hackney (type of horse/carriage)
&bull; COPPER: just copper
&bull; HERO: heroic
&bull; HONEY: honeymoon
&bull; SHRINK: shrinkwrap
&bull; SUIT: lawsuit
&bull; SOMEDAY: compound word
&bull; FANTASY: fantasyland

What about words that can be preceded by "super"?
&bull; superHERO ✓
&bull; superhack? No
&bull; supercopper? No

What about "___ story"?
&bull; HERO story ✓
&bull; FANTASY story ✓
&bull; SHORT story? SHORT is gone
&bull; LOVE story? LOVE isn't here
&bull; GHOST story? GHOST isn't here

Wait, could HACK story be a thing? "Hack story" doesn't sound right.

What about "honey story"? No.

Let me think about "___-story" as in building floors:
&bull; HERO story? No
&bull; HONEY story? No
&bull; SUIT story? No

Actually, I have a new idea: what about "___-suit"?
&bull; bathing SUIT ✓
&bull; birthday SUIT ✓ (but birthday isn't here)
&bull; laws SUIT ✓ (as in lawsuit)
&bull; wet SUIT? WET isn't here

Hmm. Let me think about "cover story" from earlier - COVER already used.

Let me reconsider the slang group again, but think about common usage:
&bull; HACK is commonly used as slang for writer
&bull; SHRINK is common slang for psychiatrist
&bull; SUIT is common slang for businessperson/executive
&bull; COPPER is British slang for police

This is actually a well-known group of slang terms for professions. NYT Connections often includes these clever groupings. I think this is it.

Then the remaining four would be:
HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

What could connect these last four? Let me think...
&bull; HERO: type of character
&bull; FANTASY: type of genre
&bull; HONEY: type of color/food/substance
&bull; SOMEDAY: adverb/time concept

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the slang group. Let me reconsider.

What if the group is:
HACK, SHRINK, SUIT, ????

No, that doesn't work.

Let me try another angle: what about "___-suit"?
&bull; lawSUIT ✓
&bull; wetSUIT? WET is gone
&bull; bathingSUIT
&bull; birthdaySUIT

Not working.

What about "___-hack"? 
&bull; HACKSAW? SAW isn't here

What about "___-hero"? 
&bull; SUPERHERO
&bull; antiHERO

Let me think about "___-fantasy"? 
&bull; finalFANTASY? FINAL isn't here

Hmm. Let me step back and look at all remaining words again:
HACK, COPPER, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

Could there be a "color" group?
&bull; HONEY (amber)
&bull; COPPER (brown/orange)
&bull; ??? What other colors? Looking at remaining words:
  - SHRINK? No
  - SUIT? No
  - HACK? No

Could there be a "genres" group?
&bull; FANTASY ✓
&bull; HERO? Not exactly a genre
&bull; SOMEDAY? No
&bull; HONEY? No

Wait, could HERO, FANTASY, SOMEDAY, and maybe something else be "types of ___"?
&bull; HERO: type of character
&bull; FANTASY: type of genre
This doesn't work.

Let me reconsider the "slang for professions" group:
&bull; HACK = writer/cheater
&bull; SHRINK = psychiatrist
&bull; SUIT = businessperson
&bull; COPPER = police

This still seems like the strongest connection. The remaining four would be:
HERO, HONEY, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

Wait, I miscounted. If I take HACK, SHRINK, SUIT, COPPER for slang, that leaves:
HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

That's only four words! So the slang group would be:
HACK, SHRINK, COPPER, and one more... but SUIT is already in that group.

Wait, let me recount:
Original: HACK, COPPER, ALTERNATE, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, BACKUP, SUIT, MELT, SOMEDAY, CONDENSE, FANTASY, FREEZE, VAPORIZE, SUB, COVER

After first guess (FREEZE, MELT, VAPORIZE, CONDENSE): removed 4
Remaining: HACK, COPPER, ALTERNATE, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, BACKUP, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY, SUB, COVER

After second guess (SUB, BACKUP, ALTERNATE, COVER): removed 4
Remaining: HACK, COPPER, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

So I have 8 words left and need 2 groups of 4.

Let me re-analyze these 8 words:
HACK, COPPER, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

Possible Group 1: HACK, SHRINK, COPPER, SUIT (slang for professions)
Possible Group 2: HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

But what connects HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY?

Let me think about this more carefully. Could there be a different grouping?

What about "___-story" again?
&bull; HERO story ✓
&bull; FANTASY story ✓  
&bull; SHORT story? No SHORT
&bull; GHOST story? No GHOST
&bull; LOVE story? No LOVE

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the four remaining words differently:

HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

Could these be "words that can be prefixed"?
&bull; superhero
&bull; honeycomb? COMB isn't here
&bull; someday
&bull; fantasyland

Or "words that can be suffixed"?
&bull; heroism
&bull; honeymoon
&bull; somedays
&bull; fantasy

Wait! HONEYMOON! MOON is already gone? No, MOON was never here. Let me check the original list again.

Original list: FREEZE, SUB, HACK, COPPER, ALTERNATE, VAPORIZE, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, BACKUP, SUIT, MELT, SOMEDAY, CONDENSE, FANTASY, COVER

MOON is NOT in the original list. So HONEY + MOON can't work.

Let me think about "___-suit" again:
&bull; lawSUIT ✓
&bull; bathingSUIT
&bull; wetSUIT
&bull; birthdaySUIT

No, that doesn't help.

What about "___-shrink"? shrinkwrap? WRAP isn't here.

Hmm. Let me think about this differently. What if HERO, FANTASY, SOMEDAY, and something else form a group about "genres" or "types"?

Wait a minute. What about "___-day"?
&bull; SOMEday ✓
&bull; HONEYday? No
&bull; HEROday? No

What about "___-some"?
&bull; HANDsome? HAND not here
&bull; FIVEsome? Not here

Let me reconsider everything. Maybe the slang group ISN'T right.

Looking at the 8 words again:
HACK, COPPER, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

Could there be an "occupations" group that's NOT slang?
&bull; HACK = writer
&bull; SHRINK = psychiatrist
&bull; SUIT = lawyer? (from lawsuit)
&bull; COPPER = police

That's still 4 occupations. But then what's left?
HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

What connects these four? Let me think about this differently.

HERO... FANTASY... SOMEDAY... HONEY...

Could these be "words that can follow 'super'?" 
&bull; superHERO ✓
&bull; superFANTASY? No
&bull; superHONEY? No
&bull; superSOMEDAY? No

Could these be "words that can follow 'sweet'?"
&bull; sweetHONEY ✓ (redundant but possible)
&bull; sweetSOMEDAY? No
&bull; sweetFANTASY? No

Could these be "words that can precede '___-man'?"
&bull; HEROman? No
&bull; FANTASYman? No

Let me think about "___-time":
&bull; SOMEDAYtime? No
&bull; FANTASY time? Not really

Wait, maybe the group is something else entirely. Let me look for different patterns.

What if the group is about "prefixes" that create new words:
&bull; superHERO
&bull; superHACK? No
&bull; superCOPPER? No

What about "suffixes":
&bull; HACKer
&bull; HEROism
&bull; FANTASYland
&bull; HONEYmoon

Wait! HONEYMOON - but MOON isn't in the words.

Let me think about "___-moon" again. HONEYMOON is a common compound word, but MOON was not in the original list. So that can't be it.

Let me reconsider HERO, FANTASY, SOMEDAY, and HONEY.

Could these be "words that can be preceded by 'pipe'?"
&bull; pipe dream? No, DREAM isn't here

Could these be "words that can follow '___-some'?" No.

Hmm, what about "___-someday"? No.

Let me think about this differently. Maybe the last four words are:
HERO, FANTASY, HACK, SOMEDAY? No.

Wait, what about "___-day"? 
&bull; SOMEday ✓

What about "___-some"? 
&bull; HANDsome? No HAND
&bull; FIVEsome? No FIVE

Actually, I just realized something. What if the group is:
HERO, FANTASY, HONEY, SOMEDAY

These could all be "types of ___" - but of what?

&bull; HERO is a type of character
&bull; FANTASY is a type of genre  
&bull; HONEY is a type of... substance? color?
&bull; SOMEDAY is a type of... adverb?

That doesn't work.

Let me reconsider the entire set of 8 words and try different combinations.

What if the group is:
COPPER, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY?

What if COPPER is a color, HONEY is a color, and the other two are something else?

Actually, wait. Let me look at "SOMEDAY" more carefully. SOMEDAY + ?

SOMEDAY + ? could be "SOMEDAY never comes" or "SOMEDAY soon"

What about "___-someday"? No.

Let me think about "___-day" again:
&bull; SOMEday ✓
&bull; HONEYday? Not a word
&bull; HEROday? Not a word

Hmm. What about "___-story" again? I've been fixated on this because HERO story and FANTASY story are so obvious.

But what if the group is:
HERO, FANTASY, SOMEDAY, and maybe HACK?

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, what if the group is:
HERO, FANTASY, HACK, SOMEDAY?

HACK story? Not really a thing.
FANTASY story? Yes.
HERO story? Yes.
SOMEDAY story? Could be but not a standard term.

Let me think about this differently. What if I'm missing something obvious?

Looking at the 8 words:
HACK, COPPER, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, SUIT, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

Could there be a "___-suit" group and a "___-shrink" group?

Or maybe:
&bull; HACK, SHRINK, COPPER, SUIT (occupations)
&bull; HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY (??)

What if HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, and FANTASY are all "types of ___" in a more abstract sense?

Wait! What about "___-moon"? HONEYMOON is a word. But MOON isn't available.

Unless... wait. HONEY + MOON. But MOON wasn't in the original list. Let me check the original list once more.

Original list: FREEZE, SUB, HACK, COPPER, ALTERNATE, VAPORIZE, HERO, HONEY, SHRINK, BACKUP, SUIT, MELT, SOMEDAY, CONDENSE, FANTASY, COVER

No, MOON is definitely not there. So HONEYMOON can't be the answer.

What about "___-suit"?
&bull; lawSUIT ✓ (SUIT is already in the word)
&bull; bathingSUIT ✓  
&bull; wetSUIT ✓
&bull; birthdaySUIT ✓

But this requires SUIT to be the suffix, not part of a compound word.

Hmm. Let me think about "___-shrink" again:
&bull; shrinkWRAP? WRAP not here
&bull; headSHRINKER? HEAD not here

Let me reconsider the occupations/slang group. I think it's:
HACK, SHRINK, COPPER, SUIT

These all refer to people in slang:
&bull; HACK = writer (or taxi driver)
&bull; SHRINK = psychiatrist
&bull; COPPER = police officer
&bull; SUIT = business executive/lawyer

This is a solid group!

Then the remaining four are:
HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

What connects these? Let me think outside the box.

Could they be "words that can be prefixed by 'super'?"
&bull; superhero ✓
&bull; superhoney? No
&bull; super someday? No
&bull; super fantasy? No

Could they be "words that can be suffixed to create compound words?"
&bull; HONEY + moon ✓
&bull; SOMEDAY + ? = someday soon
&bull; FANTASY + land ✓
&bull; HERO + ic ✓

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the connection is simpler.

What if they're "types of ___"?
&bull; HERO is a type of character
&bull; FANTASY is a type of genre
&bull; HONEY is a type of... substance
&bull; SOMEDAY is a type of... adverb

No, that doesn't work.

Let me think about "___-day":
&bull; SOMEday ✓
&bull; HONEYday? Not a word
&bull; FANTASYday? Not a word

What about "___-some"?
&bull; HANDsome? No HAND
&bull; FIVEsome? No FIVE

Let me reconsider the entire problem. Maybe the two groups are different from what I think.

What if one group is:
HERO, FANTASY, HACK, SOMEDAY?

No, I can't find the connection.

What if the group is:
COPPER, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY?

Copper is a color, honey is a color... but what are the other two?

Wait! What if the group is colors and the other group is something else?

COPPER (color), HONEY (color), and maybe... 
&bull; HERO? No
&bull; HACK? No
&bull; SHRINK? No
&bull; SUIT? No

This doesn't work.

Let me go back to my original hypothesis:
Group A: HACK, SHRINK, COPPER, SUIT (occupations/slang)
Group B: HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

What if Group B is actually about "___-story"? But in a different way?

HERO story ✓
FANTASY story ✓ 
SOMEDAY... story? Not really
HONEY... story? Not really

But wait! What if these are types of "___-something"?

HERO + worship
HONEY + moon (but MOON isn't here)
SOMEDAY + ?
FANTASY + land

Hmm. Let me think about "___-land":
&bull; FANTASYland ✓
&bull; HONEYland? Not really
&bull; HEROland? Yes (like Disney's HeroLand)

But this is getting too specific.

What if the connection is simply that these are all "positive/uplifting" concepts? 
&bull; HERO (positive)
&bull; HONEY (sweet, positive)  
&bull; SOMEDAY (hopeful)
&bull; FANTASY (positive imagination)

This could work as an abstract concept group. But it's a bit weak.

Let me reconsider the slang group one more time. I think it's correct, but let me double-check:
&bull; HACK = writer, or someone who does mediocre work, or a taxi
&bull; SHRINK = psychiatrist (common slang)
&bull; COPPER = police officer (British slang, but known)
&bull; SUIT = business executive, or lawyer (common usage)

Yes, these all work as slang for professions/roles.

Now for the last four: HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

Could these be "words that can follow 'pipe'?"
&bull; pipe dream? But DREAM isn't here

Could these be "words that can follow 'sweet'?"
&bull; sweet honey ✓ (redundant but possible)
&bull; sweet fantasy ✓
&bull; sweet someday? No
&bull; sweet hero? No

Could these be "words that can precede '___-something'?"
&bull; hero worship
&bull; honey moon
&bull; someday soon
&bull; fantasy land

I'm going in circles. Let me make a decision and go with my best guess.

I think the slang group is:
HACK, SHRINK, COPPER, SUIT

And the remaining group is:
HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

The remaining group might be "words that evoke positive/aspirational concepts" or maybe there's a more specific connection I'm missing, but the slang group is strong enough that I'm confident in it.

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider the last group one more time. 

HERO, FANTASY, SOMEDAY, HONEY

What if these are all "___-something" compound words?
&bull; HERO + worship
&bull; FANTASY + land  
&bull; SOMEDAY + soon
&bull; HONEY + moon

But again, MOON isn't in the word list.

Unless... wait. Could "honey" be used with "moon"? No, the words have to be in the original list.

Let me think: What if the group is about "___-day"?
&bull; SOMEday ✓
&bull; HONEYday? Not a thing

What about "___-hero"?
&bull; antiHERO
&bull; superHERO

But that only involves HERO.

I'm going to stick with my original plan and guess the slang group. For the remaining words, I'll just have to trust that HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, and FANTASY form a valid group, even if I'm not 100% sure of the exact reasoning yet.

Actually, I just realized something. What if the last group is:
HERO, FANTASY, HACK, SOMEDAY?

No, that doesn't work.

Wait, what if the last group is:
HERO, FANTASY, HONEY, COPPER?

Hero copper? No. Fantasy copper? No.

I'm overthinking. Let me just make my guesses.

Guess 1: HACK, SHRINK, COPPER, SUIT (slang for professions)
Guess 2: HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY (positive/aspirational concepts)

The first group is much stronger. I'll lead with that.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
HACK, SHRINK, COPPER, SUIT
&lt;/guess&gt;

NEXT GUESS?" which means my third guess was right. Now I have the final four words left.

Remaining words: HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

I need to find the connection between these four words. Let me think:

&bull; HERO
&bull; HONEY
&bull; SOMEDAY
&bull; FANTASY

What could connect these? 

Let me think about compound words or phrases:
&bull; HERO + worship
&bull; HONEY + moon (but MOON wasn't in the original list)
&bull; SOMEDAY + soon
&bull; FANTASY + land

Wait, let me think about "___ story":
&bull; HERO story ✓
&bull; FANTASY story ✓
&bull; SOMEDAY story? Not really a standard term
&bull; HONEY story? Not really a standard term

What about "___-time"?
&bull; SOMEDAY time? No

What about "___-dream"?
&bull; FANTASY dream? Redundant
&bull; HERO dream? Maybe
&bull; HONEY dream? No
&bull; SOMEDAY dream? Maybe

Hmm. "Someday dream" or "fantasy dream" could be phrases, but not strong enough.

Wait, what about looking at these as "types of" something, or concepts that go together?

&bull; HERO - someone admired
&bull; HONEY - term of endearment
&bull; SOMEDAY - expression of hope
&bull; FANTASY - imagined scenario

These all relate to positive, aspirational, or affectionate concepts. They could be "things that are associated with dreams or idealization."

But maybe there's a more specific connection. Let me think about song titles or common phrases:

&bull; "Someday My Prince Will Come" (hero/fantasy)
&bull; "Honey" (term of endearment)
&bull; "Fantasy"
&bull; "Hero"

Could these all be "words that can follow 'my'?"
&bull; my hero ✓
&bull; my honey ✓ (term of endearment)
&bull; my someday? Not really
&bull; my fantasy ✓

Not quite.

Wait, what about "___-someday"? No.

What about "___-honey"? No.

Let me reconsider everything. What if these are all "types of ___" in a very abstract way?

Actually, I might be overthinking this. Maybe the connection is simply that these are all "positive or uplifting concepts":

&bull; HERO: positive figure
&bull; HONEY: sweet, positive term
&bull; SOMEDAY: hopeful concept
&bull; FANTASY: positive imagination

But that seems too vague for NYT Connections. They usually want more specific categories.

Let me think about common phrases again:
&bull; "Pipe dream" - but DREAM isn't here
&bull; "Sweet dreams" - but DREAM isn't here

Wait! What about "___-day"?
&bull; SOMEday ✓

What about the others? Could they form compound words with "day"?
&bull; HEROday? Not common
&bull; HONEYday? Not common  
&bull; FANTASYday? Not common

No, that doesn't work.

What about "___-some"? 
&bull; HANDsome? No HAND
&bull; FIVEsome? No FIVE

Hmm.

Let me think about "Super ___":
&bull; superHERO ✓
&bull; superHONEY? No
&bull; superSOMEDAY? No
&bull; superFANTASY? No

What about "___-hero"? 
&bull; antiHERO
&bull; superHERO

But that only involves HERO.

Wait, what if the connection is about "things that can be prefixed by 'pipe'?"
&bull; pipe dream? DREAM isn't here

I need to think more creatively. What if these are all "words that can be preceded by 'sweet'?"
&bull; sweet hero? Uncommon
&bull; sweet honey ✓ (redundant but possible)
&bull; sweet someday? No
&bull; sweet fantasy ✓

Not strong enough.

What about "words that can follow 'my'?"
&bull; my hero ✓
&bull; my honey ✓
&bull; my someday? Not standard
&bull; my fantasy ✓

Still not great.

Wait, let me think about "___-someday" again. No.

What if the connection is about "song titles"? These could all be song titles:
&bull; "Hero" (multiple songs)
&bull; "Honey" (multiple songs)
&bull; "Someday" (multiple songs)
&bull; "Fantasy" (multiple songs)

But "song titles" would be too broad - many words are song titles.

Let me think about "movies" or "books"? Same issue.

What about "words that can be preceded by 'forever'?"
&bull; forever hero? Not standard
&bull; forever honey? No
&bull; forever someday? Redundant
&bull; forever fantasy? No

Hmm. Let me reconsider the whole set:

HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY, FANTASY

Could these all be "types of dreams" or "related to dreaming"?
&bull; Hero dream: dreaming of being a hero
&bull; Honey dream: sweet dream
&bull; Someday dream: dream for the future
&bull; Fantasy dream: fantasy is a type of dreaming

This is still too vague.

Wait! What about "___-com" (as in romantic comedy)? No.

What about "___-time movie"? No.

Let me think about "___-time story"? No.

Actually, I just realized something. What if these are all "words that can follow 'some'?"
&bull; someHERO? No
&bull; someHONEY? No
&bull; SOMEday ✓ (some + day)
&bull; someFANTASY? No

Hmm, SOMEDAY is literally "some day". That's a compound word.

Are any of the others compound words?
&bull; HERO? No
&bull; HONEY? No
&bull; FANTASY? No

Wait, what about "Honey" in the sense of "Honey, I'm home!" It's a term of endearment.

Could these be "terms of endearment"?
&bull; Honey ✓
&bull; Hero? Sometimes used as "my hero"
&bull; Someday? No
&bull; Fantasy? No

Let me think differently. What if they're all "___-story" in a more abstract way?

Actually, I think I need to consider that this might be an "abstract concepts" group about ideals, hopes, and positive ideas. While this is vague, it might be the intended connection given how specific the other groups were (phase transitions, substitutes, slang occupations).

Let me make sure there isn't a more concrete connection I'm missing:

&bull; HERO: admired person
&bull; HONEY: sweet substance; term of endearment
&bull; SOMEDAY: future time expression
&bull; FANTASY: imagined scenario

Could these all be "things people have"? 
&bull; have a hero ✓
&bull; have honey ✓
&bull; have someday? No
&bull; have a fantasy ✓

No, that doesn't work.

Could these be "words that can follow 'pipe'?"
&bull; pipe dream? DREAM not here

Wait! What about looking at it backwards? What if these can all be followed by the same word?

HERO ___?
HONEY ___?
SOMEDAY ___?
FANTASY ___?

HERO worship
HONEY moon (but MOON not here)
SOMEDAY soon
FANTASY land

Hmm, that gives me WORSHIP, MOON, SOON, LAND - not helpful.

What if they can all be preceded by the same word?
___ HERO?
___ HONEY?
___ SOMEDAY?
___ FANTASY?

SUPER hero
SWEET honey (redundant)
?? someday
?? fantasy

No, not working.

Let me think about this one more time. What if the connection is simply "positive concepts" or "things associated with hope and aspiration"? It's vague but might be right.

Or maybe it's "words that can be used as terms of endearment or praise"?
&bull; Hero
&bull; Honey  
&bull; Someday (as in "someday, my prince will come")
&bull; Fantasy

I'm going to go with this. It seems like the most plausible connection even if it's a bit abstract.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

Let me analyze the remaining words: ARIA, ARS, AYES, CROSSWORD, DOMINO, EASE, ENCORE, EXCALIBUR, LUXOR, ORCA, OREO, OWES.

Looking for patterns:
1. Homophones: AYES (sounds like EYES), EASE (sounds like E'S), OWES (sounds like O'S), ARS (sounds like R'S or ARSE). These four words are homophones for letters or body parts. This seems like a strong potential group.

2. Brand names/games: DOMINO and OREO could be brand names, but need two more.

3. Mythology/ancient: EXCALIBUR (Arthurian), LUXOR (Egyptian), ORCA (whale, but could be mythic), ARIA (opera). Not a clean group.

4. Words with hidden letters: This seems less likely.

The homophone connection is the clearest: AYES/EYES, EASE/E'S, OWES/O'S, ARS/R'S. These are words that sound like plural letters or body parts that are homophones for letters.

Let me verify:
&bull; AYES = EYES (homophone, plural of eye)
&bull; ARS = R's (homophone, plural of letter R) 
&bull; EASE = E's (homophone, plural of letter E)
&bull; OWES = O's (homophone, plural of letter O)

This forms a clear category: words that are homophones for plural letters (or things that sound like plural letters).</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me analyze these four words:
&bull; CROSSWORD: a puzzle game
&bull; DOMINO: a tile-based game
&bull; OREO: a cookie brand
&bull; ORCA: a type of whale

Hm, these don't immediately form an obvious group. Let me think differently.

Alternative connections:
&bull; Could be words that are also titles of something?
&bull; Could be things that can be preceded or followed by other words?

Wait, let me reconsider. What about:
&bull; CROSSWORD puzzle
&bull; DOMINO effect
&bull; OREO cookie
&bull; ORCA whale

These are all things that commonly have a specific word that follows them. But that's not a strong enough connection.

Let me think about brand names or products:
&bull; DOMINO'S (pizza chain) - but it's DOMINO not DOMINO'S
&bull; OREO is definitely a brand
&bull; ORCA - there's ORCA coolers/bags brand
&bull; CROSSWORD - there might be Crossword puzzles in newspapers, but not a strong brand

Alternative idea: These could all be names of something in computing/tech:
&bull; CROSSWORD: crossword puzzles
&bull; DOMINO: Lotus Domino (software)
&bull; OREO: Android version (Android 8.0 Oreo)
&bull; ORCA: ORCA computational chemistry software

This is too obscure.

Let me think about the words more carefully:
&bull; CROSSWORD
&bull; DOMINO
&bull; OREO
&bull; ORCA

What if these are all types of "___ pizza" or "___ cookie" or something?

Wait! OREO and DOMINO could both be types of cookies/biscuits in some regions. But crossword and orca?

Let me reconsider the entire set from the beginning to see if I missed something:

Original 16: DOMINO, EXCALIBUR, OREO, PERIMETER, VOLUME, AYES, EASE, ARS, OWES, ENCORE, LENGTH, ORCA, CROSSWORD, ARIA, LUXOR, AREA

Groups found:
1. PERIMETER, VOLUME, LENGTH, AREA - mathematical measurements ✓
2. AYES, ARS, EASE, OWES - homophones for plural letters ✓
3. EXCALIBUR, LUXOR, ARIA, ENCORE - ?

Let me reconsider group 3. What connects EXCALIBUR, LUXOR, ARIA, ENCORE?
&bull; EXCALIBUR: sword, also a casino/game
&bull; LUXOR: Egyptian temple/casino in Vegas
&bull; ARIA: opera song, also a casino/hotel in Vegas
&bull; ENCORE: to perform again, also a casino in Vegas

Oh! These are all names of Las Vegas casinos/hotels:
&bull; Excalibur Hotel &amp; Casino
&bull; Luxor Hotel &amp; Casino  
&bull; Aria Resort &amp; Casino
&bull; Encore Las Vegas

That makes sense! So group 3 is Las Vegas casinos/hotels.

Now back to the remaining 4: CROSSWORD, DOMINO, OREO, ORCA

What could connect these? Let me think...

Could these be:
&bull; Types of "___ effect"? Domino effect, but not the others
&bull; Things that have "black and white"? Orcas are black and white, Oreos are black and white, crosswords are black and white, dominoes are black and white!

Yes! That's it! All four are things that are typically black and white:
&bull; CROSSWORD puzzles are in black and white
&bull; DOMINO tiles are black and white
&bull; OREO cookies are black and white
&bull; ORCA whales are black and white

This is a very clean, unambiguous group.

CROSSWORD, DOMINO, OREO, ORCA

Now looking at the remaining words: GROUNDS, DOGS, UNCHAINED, HEAD, DIRECTOR, CHIEF, FICTION, GREEN, BROWN, LAWN, CHAIR, FIELD

I notice a strong pattern with Tarantino films:
&bull; FICTION → Pulp Fiction
&bull; DOGS → Reservoir Dogs  
&bull; UNCHAINED → Django Unchained
&bull; BROWN → Jackie Brown

All four are Quentin Tarantino movies when paired with another word. This is a classic NYT Connections pattern where words are the second part of familiar phrases.

&bull; HEAD, DIRECTOR, CHIEF, CHAIR = leadership positions (also strong)
&bull; GREEN, LAWN, FIELD, GROUNDS = grassy/outdoor areas (also possible)

Looking at these, I can identify strong candidates:
1. HORSEFEATHERS, HOGWASH, CROCK, BUNK - all slang terms meaning "nonsense"
2. BATON, HAMMER, HURDLE, POLE - all track &amp; field equipment/events
3. TAIL, HORNS, GOATEE, PITCHFORK - all features associated with the devil

The "nonsense" group is very clear and unambiguous. All four words are well-known informal terms for nonsense or rubbish. I'll go with this group next.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I can see two potential categories:
1. BATON, HAMMER, HURDLE, POLE - track &amp; field events/equipment
2. TAIL, HORNS, GOATEE, PITCHFORK - devil features

Both are strong candidates. The track &amp; field group is straightforward - baton (relay), hammer (throw), hurdle (jump), pole (vault) are all Olympic events or equipment.

The devil features group is also good - tail, horns, goatee, pitchfork are all stereotypical devil imagery.

Both are equally valid. I'll go with the track &amp; field group as it's slightly more concrete.

I can identify several potential categories:

1. <b>Words meaning rigid or awkward</b>: AWKWARD, STIFF, STILTED, and WOODEN all describe something that lacks grace, fluidity, or naturalness. This is a very strong, clear connection.

2. <b>Wood-related words</b>: WOOD, WOODEN, WOODY, WOODCHUCK, and WOODSTOCK all contain "wood". However, with only 4 words needed per category and 5 wood-related words, one must belong elsewhere.

3. <b>Tongue twister connection</b>: The words WOOD, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK, and COULD all appear in the famous tongue twister "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?" This is a clever, specific connection likely intended by the puzzle designer.

4. <b>Proper names</b>: GUTHRIE (Woody/Arlo Guthrie), WOODY (Woody Guthrie/Woody Allen), FOGHORN (Foghorn Leghorn), and SCROOGE (Ebenezer Scrooge) are all famous names.

5. <b>Music-related</b>: GUTHRIE, WOODSTOCK, CLASSICS, and CHUCK (Berry) could form a music category, but CHUCK is needed for the tongue twister.

The most confident group is the rigid/awkward category. Let me verify:
&bull; AWKWARD: lacking grace, uncomfortable
&bull; STIFF: rigid, formal, not fluid
&bull; STILTED: stiff, unnatural (especially in speech)
&bull; WOODEN: stiff, awkward, lacking expression

These four are excellent synonyms describing unnatural or rigid movement/speech. This is clearly one category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: GUTHRIE, CHUCK, CLASSICS, WOODY, WOOD, THEREFORE, FOGHORN, SCROOGE, WOODSTOCK, COULD, WOODCHUCK, CREATE

Now I need to find another group of 4 related words:

1. <b>Tongue twister category</b>: WOOD, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK, COULD - These four words all appear in the famous tongue twister: "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?" This is a very strong, specific connection.

2. <b>Proper names category</b>: FOGHORN (Leghorn), SCROOGE (Ebenezer Scrooge), WOODSTOCK (festival/character), and either GUTHRIE or WOODY (both refer to Woody Guthrie). However, GUTHRIE and WOODY are essentially the same person, so this might not work perfectly.

3. <b>Wordplay category</b>: GUTHRIE, WOODY, CLASSICS, CREATE - Not seeing a clear connection here.

4. <b>Wood-related category</b>: WOOD, WOODCHUCK, WOODY, WOODSTOCK - All contain "wood" but the tongue twister connection is more specific and clever.

The tongue twister connection (WOOD, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK, COULD) is very strong and likely intentional. Let me think about what else remains after that:

If I use: WOOD, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK, COULD for the tongue twister

Remaining would be: GUTHRIE, CLASSICS, WOODY, THEREFORE, FOGHORN, SCROOGE, WOODSTOCK, CREATE

I could then look at:
&bull; GUTHRIE, WOODY, WOODSTOCK, CLASSICS (Woody Guthrie, Woodstock festival are music classics)
&bull; GUTHRIE, WOODY, FOGHORN, SCROOGE (famous characters/names)

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider. The group of words containing "WOOD" is also strong: WOOD, WOODEN, WOODY, WOODCHUCK, WOODSTOCK. But WOODEN is already used.

Looking at my remaining words again: GUTHRIE, CHUCK, CLASSICS, WOODY, WOOD, THEREFORE, FOGHORN, SCROOGE, WOODSTOCK, COULD, WOODCHUCK, CREATE

The most clear, clever category is definitely the tongue twister. WOOD, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK, COULD are perfect. But I should check if "chuck" is really the verb or if it's just part of woodchuck.

Actually, looking more carefully: the words are CHUCK (separate from WOODCHUCK) and COULD. So yes, WOOD, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK, COULD is the tongue twister group. This has to be intentional by the puzzle maker.

I should go with this - it's 100% confidence.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

This is the final group of 4 words. Let me think about how they connect:

&bull; GUTHRIE: Woody Guthrie, the famous folk singer
&bull; CLASSICS: Could refer to classic folk songs or classic works
&bull; CREATE: To make or produce something
&bull; THEREFORE: A conjunctive adverb meaning "for that reason" or "consequently"

These words seem to form a logical sequence or statement when combined with Woody Guthrie's identity. Woody Guthrie created folk classics, therefore... 

But more likely, this is about categories or types of something. Let me reconsider:

Actually, I think I see a different pattern. In the context of the NYT Connections puzzle, sometimes the final group is about parts of speech or linguistic categories:

&bull; CLASSICS: plural noun
&bull; CREATE: verb
&bull; GUTHRIE: proper noun (name)
&bull; THEREFORE: adverb/conjunction

But that seems too generic.

Wait, let me think about Woody Guthrie specifically. He wrote "This Land Is Your Land," which became a classic American folk song. The connection might be:

GUTHRIE (the artist) + CREATE (what he did) + CLASSICS (the result) + THEREFORE (logical consequence)

But I'm not satisfied with that.

Let me try one more angle: Could these words all relate to "American folk music"?
&bull; Guthrie: Woody Guthrie, iconic folk singer
&bull; Classics: Folk songs become classics
&bull; Create: Folk artists create songs
&bull; Therefore: This "therefore" connects the folk tradition

I'm not 100% confident, but these four must go together as the only remaining words. The strongest connection is through Woody Guthrie and his contributions to American folk music.

Actually, I just realized there might be a simpler connection: these are all words that can be categorized as "things related to creation/results/causation" in a loose sense. But that feels forced.

Let me go with the most logical grouping given the constraints.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I need to find four words that share a common connection. Let me analyze patterns:

1. <b>"SWEET" category</b> - Words that can follow or precede "sweet":
   - Sweet potato (common food)
   - Sweet talk (common phrase meaning flattery)
   - Sweet tooth (common phrase meaning craving for sweets)
   - Sweet sixteen (common phrase for 16th birthday)
   
This is a very strong, unambiguous connection. All four are extremely common phrases using "sweet."

2. <b>Food items</b>: Potato, prune, pepper (only 3 clear foods)
3. <b>Verbs of dispersal</b>: Sprinkle, scatter (only 2)
4. <b>Dog breed</b>: Shar Pei (only 1)
5. <b>Party supplies</b>: Crepe paper, sprinkle, scatter (weak connection)

The "SWEET" category is clearly the best option - it's a perfect match with no ambiguity.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: BLEW, BROKE, BURST, SPLIT

These four words are all past tense verbs that describe breaking or destroying something:
&bull; BLEW: past tense of blow (as in explode or burst)
&bull; BROKE: past tense of break
&bull; BURST: past tense of burst (can also be present)
&bull; SPLIT: past tense of split

&bull; MONKEY: Abu is Aladdin's pet monkey
&bull; PARROT: Iago is Jafar's parrot sidekick

These four words are all major characters from the same movie, making a very specific and strong connection. While I also identified a potential tech category (LAG, DROP, FREEZE, ECHO) and considered other patterns, the Disney/Aladdin connection is the most distinctive and least likely to be coincidental.

Other words that could fit different categories include:
&bull; MIME (performer, imitation)
&bull; APOLLO (Greek god, space program)
&bull; SAMURAI (Japanese warrior)
&bull; REFEREE (sports official)
&bull; PRISONER (someone jailed)
&bull; SAILOR (nautical person)
&bull; DROP, LAG, FREEZE, ECHO (all tech/networking terms)

I've identified a strong pattern with four of these words: SAILOR, PRISONER, REFEREE, and MIME all have very distinctive, standardized outfits or uniforms.

&bull; Sailors have naval uniforms/sailor suits
&bull; Prisoners have prison uniforms/jumpsuits (often orange or striped)
&bull; Referees have striped uniforms
&bull; Mimes have their iconic black and white performance outfits

These are all recognizable by their specific clothing. While other words like SAMURAI also have distinctive armor and APOLLO could relate to spacesuits, the connection is strongest with these four as they all revolve around standardized uniforms/costumes in modern or performance contexts.

I also considered other potential groupings:
&bull; A "STRIPES" connection (referee, mime, prisoner outfits often striped)
&bull; Media references (Sailor Moon, The Prisoner, etc.)
&bull; A possible "four" theme (Fantastic Four, Four Candles sketch)

But the uniform/outfit connection is the clearest and most defensible grouping of four words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The connection appears to be that each of these words is part of a well-known title or phrase that includes a number:

&bull; CANDLES: "16 Candles" (iconic 1980s teen movie)
&bull; FANTASTIC: "Fantastic Four" (Marvel superhero team)
&bull; SAMURAI: "Seven Samurai" (classic Akira Kurosawa film)
