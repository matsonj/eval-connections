I see potential categories emerging:

- Words meaning to reverse a position or go back on something: ABOUT-FACE (a reversal), FLIP-FLOP (change opinions), BACKPEDAL (retreat from a stance), RENEGE (fail to honor a commitment). This seems like a strong, cohesive group.

- Another possible group: Things that move or react to wind: FLAG (waves in wind), PINWHEEL (spins in wind), VANE (weather vane indicates wind direction), WIND CHIME (chimes in wind).

- Forcing or cramming: WEDGE (force into place), JAM (cram), SHOEHORN (force into a tight space), STUFF (fill tightly).

- The rest might relate to children's TV shows: KANGAROO (Captain Kangaroo), STREET (Sesame Street), NEIGHBORHOOD (Mister Rogers' Neighborhood), RAINBOW (Reading Rainbow).

The reversal group feels like the most straightforward and confident starting point, with clear semantic connections. I'll guess that first to confirm.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- Children's TV show references: RAINBOW (Reading Rainbow), STREET (Sesame Street), KANGAROO (Captain Kangaroo), NEIGHBORHOOD (Mister Rogers' Neighborhood). These match key words from classic kids' shows.

These are all common terms—skyscraper is a tall building, skylark is a bird or verb, skydive is parachuting, skyrocket means to rise rapidly. This fits the Connections style of wordplay with compound words or phrases.

Other possible groups include car brands (FORD, DODGE, LINCOLN, RAM), singular forms of NHL teams (DUCK, FLYER, SENATOR, STAR), and party snacks (CHIP, DIP, FRY, WING). These don't overlap with my chosen group, supporting the overall puzzle structure.

I need to identify potential categories of four related words.

First, I spot words related to track and field events: BATON (as in baton relay), HURDLE (hurdles race), POLE (pole vault), HAMMER (hammer throw). These are all Olympic-style track and field implements or events.

Other potential groups: Nonsense synonyms like HORSEFEATHERS, HOGWASH, BUNK, CROCK. Knot types: SHEEPSHANK, BOWLINE, BEND, HITCH. Devil features: PITCHFORK, HORNS, GOATEE, TAIL.

The track and field group feels strong and distinct, with no overlaps, so I'll guess that first to confirm a category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Analyzing potential groups:

- Types of knots: SHEEPSHANK, BOWLINE, HITCH, BEND (all are specific knots or knot categories in sailing/ropes).

- Features associated with the devil: PITCHFORK (devil's tool), HORNS (devil's head), GOATEE (devil's beard style), TAIL (devil's appendage).

I need to find groups of four related words. In NYT Connections, categories often involve wordplay, synonyms, or shared themes like music, sports, or idioms.

First, I scan for obvious connections. Words like NATURAL and FLAT stand out because in music, they are accidentals (natural sign, flat sign). Then, WHOLE and QUARTER could refer to note durations (whole note, quarter note). Together, WHOLE, QUARTER, NATURAL, FLAT all relate to musical notation: whole note, quarter note, natural symbol, and flat symbol. This seems like a strong category, as Connections often has themes mixing related concepts within a domain like music.

I consider alternatives: FLAT could relate to tires (flat tire) with TIRE, PUMP (tire pump), but that lacks a clear fourth word (maybe STEAM? No). Or shoes (flat, pump, heel), but that would need a fourth and conflicts with this grouping. The musical connection feels more precise and fits exactly four words without leftovers forcing awkward groups.

Other potential categories I see in remaining words include expressing opinions (e.g., VOICE, SAY, VOTE, SPEAK) or exhaustion (e.g., TIRE, STEAM as in "run out of steam"), but I'll start with the musical group as it's cohesive and confident.

This is my first guess, so I'll proceed with it.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: CHOICE, SAY, STEAM, SHAKE, PUMP, VOICE, WAFFLE, HEEL, TIRE, DOWN, VOTE, SPEAK.

Analyzing connections: I notice PUMP, STEAM, TIRE, and WAFFLE can all precede "iron" to form common phrases—pump iron (weightlifting), steam iron (clothing appliance), tire iron (car tool), waffle iron (kitchen appliance). This is a typical Connections category where words complete a shared term. It's cohesive and doesn't overlap awkwardly with other potential groups.

Alternative ideas considered: Expression-related words like SAY, SPEAK, VOICE, VOTE (ways to express opinions). Or exhaustion terms like TIRE, STEAM (run out of steam), but that lacks a clear four. Shoe types like PUMP, HEEL, but FLAT is already used and no strong fourth fits. The "iron" group stands out as the strongest and most precise match.

Analyzing connections: I spot SHAKE, HEEL, DOWN, SPEAK as common dog commands—shake (paw), heel (walk beside), down (lie down), speak (bark). This is a typical Connections category involving training or pet-related terms, and it fits exactly four words without forcing others.

Alternatives considered: Words related to expression or influence like CHOICE, SAY, VOICE, VOTE (as in "have a choice/say/voice/vote"). That's also strong and would leave SHAKE, HEEL, DOWN, SPEAK confirming the dog commands. No overlaps or awkward fits, so both seem viable, but I'll guess the dog commands first as it's a precise thematic match often seen in the game.

If incorrect, I can pivot to the expression group next.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I start by looking for obvious connections. One group jumps out: words related to foul language or cursing. EXPLETIVES are curse words, PROFANITY means obscene language, SWEARING refers to using oaths or curses, and FOUR-LETTER WORDS is a common euphemism for short swear words. This seems like a tight category of synonyms or terms for bad language.

Other potential groups I see include CHRISTMAS, HOUSE, STIRRING, MOUSE (from "'Twas the Night Before Christmas" poem: "all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse"). There's also possible jewelry or accessories with NECKLACE and EARRING, maybe extending to clothing like PLEATHER VEST and MESH SHIRT. The remaining words like HERRING (as in red herring), MYSTERY, HISTAMINE, and OUROBOROS might form a group around distractions or symbols, but that's less clear.

For this guess, I'm going with the foul language category as it's the strongest and most cohesive I've identified. If correct, it eliminates these words and helps narrow down the rest.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

A strong category emerges from the famous poem "'Twas the Night Before Christmas": "not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse" and "all through the house." This directly connects STIRRING, MOUSE, HOUSE, and CHRISTMAS (the poem's setting). These words are key elements from the opening lines of the poem, forming a thematic group.

Other potential groups include possible jewelry (NECKLACE, EARRING) or clothing items (PLEATHER VEST, MESH SHIRT), but those are incomplete without two more matches. HERRING (as in red herring), MYSTERY, OUROBOROS (symbol), and HISTAMINE don't yet form a clear quartet.

I see a potential category around "linked" or "chain-like" items, often a type of wordplay or thematic connection in Connections puzzles:
- MESH SHIRT: Refers to a shirt made of mesh fabric, which is a network of linked material, similar to chain mail.
- NECKLACE: Typically consists of a chain or linked beads.
- EARRING: Can be a hoop or chain style, forming a link or loop.
- OUROBOROS: A symbolic figure of a serpent forming a continuous loop by eating its own tail, essentially a self-linked chain.

This seems cohesive as a "chain/link" themed group. The other words don't fit this as neatly, so if correct, it leaves HISTAMINE, PLEATHER VEST, MYSTERY, HERRING for the final group, which might relate to misdirection or another theme (e.g., red herring in a mystery, pleather as faux, histamine as a "false alarm" in allergies), but I'll confirm that next if this succeeds.

Analyzing the remaining words, a strong category appears to be restaurant seating or dining areas: BAR (as in sit at the bar), BOOTH (booth seating), COUNTER (counter seating, like a lunch counter), TABLE (table seating). This fits a common Connections theme of related locations or items in a specific context, like a diner or restaurant.

Other potential groups include touchscreen/phone gestures or actions: PINCH, SCROLL, SWIPE, TAP. That also seems solid. The remaining words (ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH) are trickier, possibly a wordplay category like homophones or something niche (e.g., sounding like "ail, eek, hive, quash" but no clear link yet).

I look for possible connections. One potential category is evaluation or assessment terms: RATE (as in rate something), SCORE (as in score a test), GRADE (assign a grade), RANK (rank items). These all relate to judging or scoring performance.

Another possible group is signs of nervousness or anxiety: SWEAT (nervous sweat), FIDGET (fidget from nerves), PACE (pace back and forth anxiously), BLUSH (blush from embarrassment).

I also spot "things that can run": MASCARA (runs when crying), NOSE (runny nose), STOCKINGS (runs in nylons), DYE (dye runs in wash).

Finally, a clever one emerges: words that complete "paper ___": CLIP (paper clip), TIGER (paper tiger), TOWEL (paper towel), TRAIL (paper trail). This fits perfectly as compound phrases.

All words now fit into these four groups without overlap, confirming the connections. For this guess, I choose the "paper ___" category as it's a strong, thematic fit typical of Connections puzzles, and I'm highly confident in it.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The other likely group is signs of nervousness or anxiety: SWEAT (nervous sweating), FIDGET (fidgeting from nerves), PACE (pacing anxiously), BLUSH (blushing from embarrassment). These fit well as behavioral indicators.

Other possible groups include camera brands (POLAROID, HASSELBLAD, OLYMPUS, FUJIFILM) and Italian place-named terms (BOLOGNESE from Bologna, NEAPOLITAN from Naples, VENETIAN from Venice, PARMESAN from Parma).

Strong potential category: Camera and photography brands. POLAROID (instant cameras), HASSELBLAD (high-end cameras), OLYMPUS (camera brand), FUJIFILM (film and cameras). These are all companies known primarily for cameras or photographic equipment. No overlaps with other obvious groups.

Other possible groups still include the Italian-named items: BOLOGNESE, NEAPOLITAN, VENETIAN, PARMESAN.

Stadium-related: JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM, SKYBOX, SCOREBOARD – but that was wrong, maybe it's JUMBOTRON, SCOREBOARD, KISSCAM, ASTROTURF? Astroturf is used in stadiums. But my first guess had 3/4 right? The feedback was just INCORRECT, which might mean not a full category.

Identifying potential categories.

This fits Connections-style categories of eponyms or place-derived terms. No overlaps with other words, and it's cohesive.

The stadium group was incorrect before, so avoiding that exact set. Other possible groups (e.g., stadium features with a tweak like ASTROTURF instead of one) are less certain, but this Italian category stands out as strong and unexplored.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I need to identify potential categories of four related words. Starting with analysis:

- Several words relate to "beginning" or "origin": GENESIS (origin or biblical book of beginnings), START (to begin), BIRTH (beginning of life), DAWN (beginning of the day). This seems like a strong potential group, but I'll check for others first.

- Another clear connection: words meaning "to join" or "unite": BOND (to join or adhere), COMBINE (to merge), FUSE (to blend together), WED (to marry or unite). This fits perfectly as synonyms for joining things.

- Other possible groups: Acronyms or 80s pop culture items like ALF (TV show), MTV (channel), NES (game console), VHS (video format) – all three-letter abbreviations from 80s entertainment.

- Less clear: FLY, POLE, FLOWER, DAY – could be parts of idioms or something like "flagpole," "fly," "flower child," "day," but not cohesive yet.

The "join" group stands out as the most straightforward and least overlapping with others. It doesn't conflict with the "beginning" group, and the words are directly synonymous. I'll guess this first to confirm a category, as it's a safe starting point with high confidence. If incorrect, it will narrow down options.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Analyzing connections: A strong category emerges around "beginnings" or "origins." GENESIS refers to the book of beginnings or origin, START means to begin, BIRTH is the start of life, and DAWN is the beginning of the day (or metaphorically, the dawn of an era). These are direct synonyms or related concepts for starting something.

Other potential groups include 1980s entertainment abbreviations like ALF (TV show), MTV (channel), NES (console), VHS (format), which seems promising but I'll pursue later if needed. Words like FLY, POLE, FLOWER, DAY don't immediately form a clear group with these (e.g., not obviously parts of flowers or poles).

Two groups of four left. One clear category is 1980s entertainment and technology abbreviations/acronyms: ALF (TV show about an alien, 1986), MTV (music television channel, launched 1981), NES (Nintendo Entertainment System, 1985), VHS (Video Home System, popular video format in the 80s). These are all three-letter initialisms tied to 80s pop culture.

The other potential group with the leftovers (FLY, POLE, DAY, FLOWER) appears to be things that complete "May ___" phrases: May Day (holiday), Maypole (decorated pole for dancing), Mayfly (insect), Mayflower (famous ship or plant). This also fits neatly.

Both seem strong, but I'll guess the 80s acronyms first as they align closely with a specific era and theme, and it's a common Connections style for cultural references. If incorrect, it will help confirm the other group.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I looked for potential categories. One clear grouping stands out as synonyms for ghost or supernatural apparition: WIGHT (archaic/fantasy term for a supernatural being or undead), SPECTER (ghostly figure), SPIRIT (ghost or ethereal being), SHADE (literary term for a ghost or spirit of the dead). This seems like a strong, cohesive category based on thematic similarity.

Other potential categories I considered include music genres/styles (e.g., AMERICANA, JAZZ, RAP, CHORAL) and prediction methods (e.g., DIVINE, FORECAST, READ, CALL), leaving BLEW, BROKE, BURST, SPLIT as possibly related to breaking or separating suddenly.

Analyzing potential categories:

- Music styles or genres: AMERICANA (a roots music genre), JAZZ, RAP, CHORAL (relating to choir music). This seems like a solid group, as they all refer to types or styles of music.

- Prediction or divination methods: FORECAST (predict the future, e.g., weather), DIVINE (to foresee or intuit), READ (as in read tarot or palms), CALL (as in call an outcome or predict). This is another plausible category, though "call" is a bit looser.

- Breaking or separating: BLEW (as in blew apart or exploded), BROKE, BURST, SPLIT. These could relate to sudden breaking or departing, but it's not as tight as the music group.

- Other possibilities include financial ruin (BROKE, BLEW money, BURST bubble, SPLIT assets), but that feels stretched.

The music category stands out as the strongest and most cohesive, with clear connections to musical forms. I'll guess that next to build on the progress.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

This fits thematically as ways to anticipate or prophesy.

- Another possible group: BLEW, BROKE, BURST, SPLIT, which could relate to breaking apart suddenly (e.g., blew up, broke, burst, split). This is cohesive but slightly looser in direct synonymy.

- Other ideas like past tenses or homophones (e.g., BLEW/blue, READ/red) don't yield a clean group of 4.

All of these are iconic roles played or voiced by Eddie Murphy. This seems like a strong thematic connection for a category like "Eddie Murphy roles" or "Characters portrayed by Eddie Murphy." No other words fit this as cleanly, so I'm selecting these four for my first guess. If correct, it eliminates them from future use.

One potential group is expressions of disapproval or scolding: TUT TUT (an exclamation of disapproval), TSK (a sound of disapproval, often written as tsk-tsk), SHAME (as in "shame on you"), and BAD (as in scolding someone with "bad dog" or similar). This fits thematically as ways to express censure or reproach.

Another possible group is words meaning to move quickly: ZIP (zip along), FLY (fly down the road), RACE (race ahead), BARREL (barrel forward). That leaves the disapproval group as the counterpart, which aligns well without overlaps.

I need to identify potential categories of four related words. Starting by scanning for connections:

- Kitchen/cooking appliances or methods stand out: MICROWAVE, STOVETOP, KETTLE, POPPER. These could relate to ways to prepare popcorn (microwave popcorn, stovetop popping, kettle corn, popcorn popper). This seems like a solid category, as Connections often has themes around food preparation.

- Another potential group: KIND, SWEET, TENDER, WARM – all describe a gentle, affectionate, or mild disposition (e.g., kind person, sweet nature, tender heart, warm demeanor).

- Waste time or idle away: FIDDLE (fiddle around/away), FRITTER (fritter away), TRIFLE (trifle away), THROW (throw away time). This fits phrases meaning to squander time.

- Appendages or limbs in animals: ARM (human/primate), WING (bird), FIN (fish), FLIPPER (marine mammal like dolphin or seal).

These four groups cover all 16 words without overlap, which is a good sign. For my first guess, I'll go with the popcorn preparation group because it's concrete and directly tied to common usage, giving me high confidence. If correct, it eliminates these words for future guesses.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Continuing to analyze potential categories:

- One strong group appears to be animal appendages or limbs used for movement: ARM (human/primate limb), WING (bird limb for flying), FIN (fish limb for swimming), FLIPPER (marine mammal limb like a seal or dolphin for swimming). These are all body parts adapted for propulsion in different environments.

- Another potential: KIND, SWEET, TENDER, WARM – descriptors of a gentle or affectionate personality.

- And: FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW – verbs that can mean to waste or squander (fiddle away, fritter away, trifle away, throw away).

These groups still cover the remaining words neatly. I'll guess the appendages group next, as it's a clear thematic connection often seen in Connections puzzles, with good confidence.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The other likely group is KIND, SWEET, TENDER, WARM – adjectives describing a gentle, caring, or mild personality (kind-hearted, sweet-natured, tender feelings, warm personality).

I need to find groups of 4 related words. Possible connections:

- Purple-related: LAVENDER (color/plant), EGGPLANT (purple vegetable), AMETHYST (purple gem), GRIMACE (purple McDonald's character).
- Bits of wisdom or information: NUGGET (nugget of wisdom/info), KERNEL (kernel of truth), TIDBIT (small piece of info), PEARL (pearl of wisdom).
- Jurassic Park elements: AMBER (fossilized resin with DNA), MOSQUITO (insect trapped in amber), DINOSAUR (revived creatures), PALEONTOLOGIST (expert like Alan Grant).
- Ways to "make" money (idioms for earning a lot): MINT (make a mint), BUNDLE (make a bundle), PILE (make a pile), FORTUNE (make a fortune).

All words fit into these four categories without overlap. The "bits of wisdom/info" group seems particularly strong and common in Connections puzzles, as it relies on idiomatic expressions.

I see potential categories emerging. One strong connection is words that precede "rabbit" in famous character or title names: WHITE (White Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland), VELVETEEN (The Velveteen Rabbit), ROGER (Roger Rabbit from Who Framed Roger Rabbit), and TRIX (Trix Rabbit from the cereal ads). This fits as a pop culture/literary category, which is common in Connections. The words are exact matches for the blanks in "____ Rabbit."

Other potential groups include synonyms for observe/follow (FOLLOW, TRACK, MONITOR, WATCH), ink-related items (SQUID, PEN, PRINTER, TATTOO MACHINE), and things associated with the number 12 (ROSE as in dozen roses, DONUT as in dozen donuts, MONTH as in 12 months, JUROR as in 12 jurors).

I notice several words that can describe awkward, rigid, or unnatural behavior or speech: AWKWARD (directly means uncomfortable or clumsy), STILTED (unnatural or stiff in manner), STIFF (rigid or formal), and WOODEN (lacking ease or flexibility, like in acting). These seem to form a clear category of synonyms for stiff/awkward demeanor. This connection stands out as strong and doesn't overlap with other potential groups I see immediately.

I analyzed potential groupings. One strong connection stands out: words from the famous tongue twister "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?" The words WOOD, WOODCHUCK, COULD, and CHUCK are direct key elements from this phrase. NYT Connections often features categories based on idioms, phrases, or tongue twisters, so this fits well. Other possibilities like folk music (WOODY, GUTHRIE, WOODSTOCK) lack a clear fourth word, or cartoon characters (FOGHORN, WOODY, WOODSTOCK, SCROOGE) feel weaker and less cohesive.

After removing the previous correct groups, I looked for new connections. A standout category is cartoon characters that are birds: FOGHORN (Foghorn Leghorn, a rooster from Looney Tunes), WOODY (Woody Woodpecker), WOODSTOCK (Woodstock from Peanuts), SCROOGE (Scrooge McDuck from Disney). This fits NYT Connections style, where categories often involve pop culture figures sharing a trait like being anthropomorphic birds. Other potential groupings, such as folk music-related (WOODY, GUTHRIE, WOODSTOCK) lack a strong fourth word without forcing it, and don't connect as cleanly. Logical or philosophical terms around THEREFORE also don't form a full group of four. The cartoon birds category feels solid and cohesive.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

These are the last four words, so they must form the final category. After careful analysis, I identify a connection related to philosophy, specifically ancient Greek philosophy: CLASSICS refers to the study of ancient Greek and Roman texts and thinkers; CREATE relates to the concept of creation in works like Plato's Timaeus, where the demiurge creates the cosmos; GUTHRIE refers to W.K.C. Guthrie, a renowned scholar and author of "A History of Greek Philosophy"; THEREFORE is a key term in logical reasoning and philosophical arguments, such as syllogisms used by Aristotle and others.

In NYT Connections, words are grouped into four categories of four related words each, often with clever or thematic connections.

I start by scanning for obvious themes. GENIE, PRINCESS, MONKEY, and PARROT stand out as characters from Disney's Aladdin: the Genie, Princess Jasmine, Abu the monkey, and Iago the parrot. This seems like a strong category, possibly "Aladdin characters."

Next, I see MIME, REFEREE, PRISONER, SAILOR – these could relate to striped outfits or uniforms (mimes often wear striped shirts, referees have striped jerseys, prisoners in classic depictions have striped suits, and sailors have striped Breton shirts).

Then, LAG, DROP, FREEZE, ECHO might be technical glitches or issues in gaming/video calls (lag in connection, dropped frames/calls, freezing screens, audio echo).

Finally, SAMURAI, CANDLES, FANTASTIC, APOLLO could represent movie titles with numbers omitted: Seven Samurai, Sixteen Candles, Fantastic Four, Apollo 13.

Looking at patterns: MIME, REFEREE, PRISONER, SAILOR all connect via striped clothing or uniforms – mimes wear black-and-white striped shirts, referees have striped jerseys, prisoners in cartoons/old depictions have striped outfits, and sailors often wear striped nautical shirts. This seems like a solid category, possibly "things with stripes" or "striped uniforms."

Other potential groups include LAG, DROP, FREEZE, ECHO as tech glitches (e.g., video lag, dropped calls, screen freeze, audio echo), and SAMURAI, CANDLES, FANTASTIC, APOLLO as movies with omitted numbers (Seven Samurai, Sixteen Candles, Fantastic Four, Apollo 13).

This could be a category like "video conferencing mishaps" or "tech glitches."

The other group appears to be SAMURAI, CANDLES, FANTASTIC, APOLLO, which match movie titles with numbers removed: Seven Samurai, Sixteen Candles, Fantastic Four, Apollo 13. This is a common Connections trope of omitting numbers from titles.
