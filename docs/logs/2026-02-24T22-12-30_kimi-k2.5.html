1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

The phrase explicitly lists these actions: "Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive, and Dodge." While there are technically 5 D's (with Dodge repeated), the four unique words present in the list are DODGE, DUCK, DIP, and DIVE. This is a very strong pop culture reference that fits perfectly.

Other potential strong groups I notice:
&bull; NHL teams: FLYER (Flyers), SENATOR (Senators), STAR (Stars), WING (Red Wings)
&bull; Car manufacturers: RAM, FORD, LINCOLN, DODGE
&bull; Appetizers: CHIP, DIP, FRY, WING

However, the dodgeball reference is the most specific and least ambiguous. Even though DODGE could also fit car makers, the grouping with DUCK, DIP, and DIVE is iconic. I'll start with this guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
DODGE, DUCK, DIP, DIVE

So the dodgeball D's theory was wrong, or at least not the intended grouping. Let me reconsider.

Let me look at the words again:
SCRAPER, DUCK, RAM, CHIP, FLYER, FRY, STAR, ROCKET, LINCOLN, LARK, DIP, DIVE, FORD, DODGE, WING, SENATOR

Potential groupings:

NHL Hockey Teams:
&bull; FLYER (Philadelphia Flyers)
&bull; SENATOR (Ottawa Senators)
&bull; STAR (Dallas Stars)
&bull; WING (Detroit Red Wings)
That's 4! This seems very strong.

Car Manufacturers/Models:
&bull; RAM (truck brand)
&bull; FORD (car company)
&bull; LINCOLN (Ford luxury brand)
&bull; DODGE (car company)
That's 4! Also very strong.

Birds:
&bull; DUCK
&bull; LARK
&bull; Could be others...

Let me check if there are other possibilities.

Appetizers/Foods:
&bull; CHIP
&bull; DIP
&bull; FRY (French fry)
&bull; WING (chicken wing)

This is also 4!

So I have at least 3 strong potential groups:
1. NHL teams: FLYER, SENATOR, STAR, WING
2. Car brands: RAM, FORD, LINCOLN, DODGE
3. Appetizers: CHIP, DIP, FRY, WING (but WING is used in NHL... wait, can words belong to multiple groups? Usually yes, but only one is correct)

Wait, I need to check if WING can be both. If WING is used in NHL, it can't be in appetizers.

Let me reconsider. Maybe I should try the NHL teams first? Or car brands?

Actually, looking at the pattern, NHL teams ending in S (but without the S):
&bull; Flyers → FLYER
&bull; Senators → SENATOR
&bull; Stars → STAR
&bull; Red Wings → WING

That's a very clean pattern!

Car brands:
&bull; RAM, FORD, DODGE are all Ford Motor Company brands? No, RAM is Stellantis (formerly FCA), FORD and LINCOLN are Ford Motor Company, DODGE is Stellantis.

But RAM, FORD, LINCOLN, DODGE are all vehicle manufacturers.

Let me think about other patterns.

Birds: DUCK, LARK... that's only 2 clear ones.

Types of dives/swimming: DIVE, DUCK (as in duck dive), DIP... not strong.

Let me try the NHL teams. That seems most distinctive.

Actually, wait. Let me look at car manufacturers again. RAM, FORD, DODGE, LINCOLN - these are all car companies/brands.

But if I try NHL: FLYER, SENATOR, STAR, WING

Or appetizers: CHIP, DIP, FRY, WING

WING appears in both NHL and appetizers.

Let me see if there's a way to distinguish.

Actually, looking at the word list, I notice:
&bull; SCRAPER (hockey scraper? or web scraper?)
&bull; ROCKET
&bull; CHIP

Hockey items:
&bull; SCRAPER (ice scraper for hockey?)
&bull; PUCK (not here)

Maybe I should try the car brands? RAM, FORD, DODGE, LINCOLN?

Or maybe it's NHL: FLYER, SENATOR, STAR, WING

Given that WING conflicts between NHL and appetizers, and I have to choose, NHL teams is a very specific category (professional sports teams from the same league, all with the S dropped). That's a strong pattern.

Let me try NHL teams.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

I see a strong category: <b>Verbs meaning "to prepare/equip"</b>:
&bull; EQUIP (to provide with necessary items)
&bull; PREPARE (to make ready)
&bull; OUTFIT (to provide with clothing/gear)
&bull; READY (to prepare, as in "ready the troops")

This seems like a solid group.

Another potential category: <b>Organizations/Institutions</b>:
&bull; NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
&bull; NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)  
&bull; N.F.L. (National Football League)
&bull; PARAMOUNT (major media corporation)
All are well-known American organizations.

This leaves: ABLE, GAME, DOWN, EAGER, SUBARU, EAVE, CANE, WILLING

For the remaining 8, I see potential for <b>Adjectives meaning "willing/eager"</b>:
&bull; ABLE (ready, willing, and able)
&bull; GAME (slang: "I'm game")
&bull; DOWN (slang: "I'm down")
&bull; WILLING

That would leave: SUBARU, EAVE, CANE, EAGER

Or alternatively: GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING (slang/informal terms for willing)
Leaving: ABLE, SUBARU, EAVE, CANE

Another option for the last group could involve <b>EAVE</b> (eaves of a roof) and <b>CANE</b> (sugar cane, candy cane), but I'm not seeing the connection with SUBARU.

Actually, I recall that <b>SUBARU</b> is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster. Could there be an astronomy connection? Not obvious with the others.

Wait - looking at slang terms for "willing": GAME and DOWN are very strong slang matches. EAGER and READY could also fit there, but READY is likely in the prepare group.

Let me reconsider. The prepare group seems very solid: {EQUIP, PREPARE, OUTFIT, READY}.

For the organizations: {NASA, NOAA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT} - this works, though PARAMOUNT is a private company while others are government agencies or sports leagues.

This leaves: ABLE, GAME, DOWN, EAGER, SUBARU, EAVE, CANE, WILLING

Actually, looking at WILLING, ABLE, GAME, DOWN - all mean "willing to participate."
This leaves: EAGER, SUBARU, EAVE, CANE.

Or: ABLE, EAGER, GAME, WILLING? Leaves DOWN, SUBARU, EAVE, CANE.

Given the constraints, my strongest first guess is the preparation verbs since that's unambiguous.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: ABLE, GAME, DOWN, EAGER, PARAMOUNT, NOAA, SUBARU, EAVE, NASA, CANE, WILLING, N.F.L.

Looking at the organizations again:
&bull; NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
&bull; NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)
&bull; N.F.L. (National Football League)
&bull; PARAMOUNT (major media corporation)

This is still a strong category: Organizations/Institutions.

But let me check alternatives. Looking at slang terms for "willing/eager":
&bull; GAME (slang: "I'm game")
&bull; DOWN (slang: "I'm down")
&bull; ABLE (ready, willing, and able)
&bull; WILLING

Or maybe: GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING as slang terms?

And ABLE, EAGER, READY, WILLING? But READY was already used.

Actually, looking at the remaining: ABLE, GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING - that's 5 words.

Wait: ABLE, GAME, DOWN, WILLING could mean "willing to participate" (slang/informal)
And EAGER could also fit there.

But then what about the organizations?

NOAA, NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT - that's 4 organizations.

This leaves: ABLE, GAME, DOWN, EAGER, SUBARU, EAVE, CANE, WILLING

Hmm, I need to decide between:
1. Organizations: NOAA, NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT (leaving slang words and SUBARU, EAVE, CANE)
2. Slang for willing: GAME, DOWN, WILLING, ABLE? Or including EAGER?

If I take the organizations, I have left: ABLE, GAME, DOWN, EAGER, SUBARU, EAVE, CANE, WILLING
From these 8, I need to find 2 groups of 4.

Potential: ABLE, GAME, DOWN, WILLING (slang for willing)
Leaves: EAGER, SUBARU, EAVE, CANE - not obvious.

Or: GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING (eager/willing)
Leaves: ABLE, SUBARU, EAVE, CANE

Wait - could SUBARU, EAVE, CANE, and something else go together?

EAVE (eaves)
CANE (candy cane, sugar cane, walking cane)
SUBARU (car brand, also Pleiades)
ABLE?

Or is there a wordplay? EAVE sounds like EVE? CANE sounds like CAN?

Actually, thinking about "___ DROP":
&bull; EAVE (eavesdrop)
&bull; Could work with others?

Let me try the organizations first - it's the cleanest category remaining.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
NOAA, NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT

So in {NOAA, NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT}, one doesn't belong.

Likely candidates:
&bull; PARAMOUNT is a private entertainment company; the others are government agencies or sports leagues
&bull; Or N.F.L. is sports while others are... wait, NOAA and NASA are government scientific agencies, N.F.L. is sports league, Paramount is entertainment

Maybe the category isn't just "organizations" but something more specific?

Government agencies: NOAA, NASA... that's only 2.
Acronyms: NOAA, NASA, N.F.L. are all acronyms pronounced as letters. PARAMOUNT is not an acronym.

Wait - could it be agencies with "National" in the name?
&bull; NOAA: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
&bull; NASA: National Aeronautics and Space Administration  
&bull; N.F.L.: National Football League
&bull; Paramount: ...not "National"

Or maybe it's about space/astronomy?
&bull; NASA (space agency)
&bull; NOAA (weather/earth observation - satellites)
&bull; Subaru (the car company is named after the Pleiades star cluster!)
&bull; And... something else?

Actually, SUBARU is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster! That's a key insight.

So maybe: Things related to stars/constellations?
&bull; SUBARU (Pleiades)
&bull; NASA (space agency)
&bull; NOAA (has satellites, but weak)
&bull; Or EAGER? No...

Or organizations that are also acronyms pronounced as words vs. letters?
&bull; NASA (acronym pronounced as word)
&bull; NOAA (acronym pronounced as word - "Noah")
&bull; PARAMOUNT (not an acronym)
&bull; N.F.L. (acronym pronounced as letters - "En Eff Ell")

Actually, N.F.L. is typically pronounced letter by letter, while NASA and NOAA are pronounced as words. That's a difference!

But what about the remaining words and the "one away" clue?

If I swap out PARAMOUNT for something else... what could fit with NOAA, NASA, N.F.L.?

Or swap out N.F.L. - maybe it's not about organizations at all?

Let me reconsider. What if the category is something like "Things with 'National' in the full name"?
&bull; NOAA (National...)
&bull; NASA (National...)
&bull; N.F.L. (National...)
&bull; And... who else? ABLE? No. GAME? No.

Wait, could SUBARU fit there? No, it's Japanese.

What about EAGER? No.

Let me think about what else could group with three of these.

If the category is federal government agencies:
&bull; NOAA (yes)
&bull; NASA (yes)
&bull; N.F.L. (no, private sports league)
&bull; PARAMOUNT (no, private company)

So if I swap N.F.L. for... what? There's no other federal agency.

If the category is "Major American institutions/organizations" - all 4 fit.

Let me look at the other potential groupings again.

Words remaining after my first correct guess: ABLE, GAME, DOWN, EAGER, PARAMOUNT, NOAA, SUBARU, EAVE, NASA, CANE, WILLING, N.F.L.

What about words that follow "READY"?
&bull; READY... no, READY was in the first group.

What about words that precede or follow something else?

SLANG FOR "WILLING":
&bull; GAME ("I'm game")
&bull; DOWN ("I'm down")
&bull; EAGER? (not really slang, more standard)
&bull; WILLING (standard)
&bull; ABLE ("ready, willing and able")

Actually, looking at ABLE, GAME, DOWN, WILLING - these are all slang/informal ways to say you're willing to do something.

That leaves: EAGER, PARAMOUNT, NOAA, SUBARU, EAVE, NASA, CANE, N.F.L.

And from the incorrect guess, I know that 3 of {NOAA, NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT} are correct together.

If PARAMOUNT is the odd one out, then NOAA, NASA, N.F.L. go together. But what do they share?
&bull; All have "National" in the name
&bull; All are major American institutions
&bull; All are acronyms? No, Paramount isn't.

Wait - could the category be "Organizations with initials that form another word or are pronounceable"?
&bull; NASA (pronounceable)
&bull; NOAA (pronounceable as "Noah")
&bull; N.F.L. (not pronounceable as a word, letter by letter)
&bull; PARAMOUNT (not an acronym)

Hmm, N.F.L. doesn't fit if the category is "acronyms pronounced as words."

Unless... the category is "agencies/organizations with 'National' in the full name"?
&bull; NOAA ✓
&bull; NASA ✓
&bull; N.F.L. ✓
&bull; And who else?

Could it be... no other organization fits.

Unless I'm wrong about what the 3 correct ones are.

What if PARAMOUNT is correct, and one of the others isn't?

If PARAMOUNT, NOAA, NASA are correct... what's the link? 
&bull; All can precede or follow something?
&bull; All have 6 letters? PARAMOUNT (9), no.

What about the SUBARU insight? Subaru is the Pleiades. 
&bull; NASA (space)
&bull; NOAA (weather, uses satellites)
&bull; And what else?

Actually, thinking about "___ Pictures" or movie studios... Paramount Pictures.

What about organizations that can precede "Pictures"?
&bull; Paramount Pictures

Not helpful.

Let me think about the remaining 8 words after removing a potential slang group.

If ABLE, GAME, DOWN, WILLING are one group (slang for willing)...

Remaining: EAGER, PARAMOUNT, NOAA, SUBARU, EAVE, NASA, CANE, N.F.L.

And I need to find 2 groups of 4.

What about: NASA, NOAA, N.F.L., and... EAGER? No.

What if the category with 3 correct from my guess is "Things associated with stars/space"?
&bull; NASA (space agency)
&bull; SUBARU (Pleiades star cluster)
&bull; And maybe others?

Or "Acronyms":
&bull; NASA
&bull; NOAA
&bull; N.F.L.
&bull; And... SCUBA? No.

Wait, could EAVE be part of a word? EAVESDROP.

And CANE? SUGARCANE, CANDY CANE, WALKING CANE.

And SUBARU? Cars.

What about compound words or phrases with body parts or objects?
&bull; CANE (candy cane, sugar cane, walking cane, cane toad?)
&bull; EAVE (eavesdrop, eaves)

Actually, thinking about "_____ DROP":
&bull; EAVESDROP
&bull; Could work with others?

Or things that can follow "SUGAR"?
&bull; SUGARCANE
&bull; And... no.

Let me reconsider the "National" organizations. If 3 of my 4 are correct, and the link is "National [something]", then:
&bull; NOAA: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
&bull; NASA: National Aeronautics and Space Administration
&bull; N.F.L.: National Football League
&bull; And... is there anything else with National?

Wait, could "ABLE" be part of something? No.

What about "PARAMOUNT"? It means "supreme, highest". Not national.

So if the category is "National ___", then PARAMOUNT is out, and I need a 4th "National ___" word. But there isn't one!

Unless... the category isn't "National ___" but something else that 3 of them share.

What if NASA is the odd one out?
Then NOAA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT... what do they share? Not obvious.

What if NOAA is the odd one out?
NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT...

What if N.F.L. is the odd one out?
NOAA, NASA, PARAMOUNT... all major American institutions?

But then what is the 4th? 

And I still need to place SUBARU, which is nagging at me because I know it's the Pleiades.

Let me think about star/constellation connections:
&bull; SUBARU = Pleiades (star cluster)
&bull; Could NASA fit? Yes, space.
&bull; Could NOAA fit? They use satellites, but weak.
&bull; Could EAGER fit? No.

Or car brands? Only SUBARU.

What about Japanese words used in English?
&bull; SUBARU (Japanese for Pleiades)
&bull; TSUNAMI (not here)
&bull; Could others be Japanese?

No.

Let me try a different approach. What can precede "BEAR"?
&bull; GRIZZLY BEAR
&bull; POLAR BEAR
&bull; Could work with SUBARU? No.

What about anagrams?
&bull; EAVE -&gt; ?
&bull; CANE -&gt; ?
&bull; NASA -&gt; ?
&bull; NOAA -&gt; ?

Not obvious.

What about words that contain other words?
&bull; CANE contains CAN
&bull; EAVE contains EVE
&bull; NASA contains...
&bull; NOAA contains...

Or hidden words?
&bull; PARAMOUNT contains AMOUNT, MOUNT, A, R, PARAM (no)

Let me go back to the slang idea. If ABLE, GAME, DOWN, WILLING mean "willing to participate"...

Then I have: EAGER, PARAMOUNT, NOAA, SUBARU, EAVE, NASA, CANE, N.F.L. left.

What if NASA, NOAA, and N.F.L. are correct (National organizations), and the 4th is... wait, there is no other National organization.

Unless... the category is "Major American [something]" and PARAMOUNT fits, but one of the others doesn't.

Or... what if the category is "Acronyms pronounced as words" and N.F.L. doesn't fit (pronounced letter by letter), so the group is NASA, NOAA, and... who else?

SCUBA, LASER, etc. - not here.

Unless... EAVE? No.

What about things that can follow "CANDY"?
&bull; CANDY CANE
&bull; And... ?

Or "WALKING"?
&bull; WALKING CANE

Or "SUGAR"?
&bull; SUGAR CANE

So CANE is versatile.

EAVE: EAVESDROP, EAVES (plural of EAVE, but usually used as EAVES)

What about words that become other words when you change one letter?
&bull; CANE -&gt; CAN, CANNE (no), CANA (no), CANED, CANES, CANER, CANED...
&bull; EAVE -&gt; EAVES, EAVED, HEAVE, LEAVE, WEAVE, EVE, AVE
&bull; NASA -&gt;...
&bull; NOAA -&gt; NOAH (just change A to H!)

Oh! NOAA -&gt; NOAH (change last letter)
EAVE -&gt; EAVE (contains EVE, or HEAVE, LEAVE, WEAVE)

Wait, what about anagrams or near-anagrams to names?
&bull; NOAA ~ NOAH
&bull; EAVE ~ EVE (first 3 letters, or contained in HEAVE, LEAVE)
&bull; CANE ~ CANA (as in Cana, where Jesus turned water to wine?), or CENA, or just CAN

Not strong.

What about biblical names hidden?
&bull; NOAH (in NOAA)
&bull; EVE (in EAVE, or HEAVE, LEAVE, WEAVE, CLEAVE)
&bull; ABLE -&gt; ABEL (Biblical figure!)
&bull; CAIN? Not here, but CANE is close!

ABLE -&gt; ABEL (just swap L and E!)
CANE -&gt; CAIN (change N to I, or just think of it as homophone-ish)

So: ABLE (Abel), CANE (Cain), EAVE (Eve), and... NOAH (NOAA)?

That's 4! ABLE, CANE, EAVE, NOAA - all can be changed slightly to become biblical names:
&bull; ABLE -&gt; ABEL
&bull; CANE -&gt; CAIN
&bull; EAVE -&gt; EVE (or HEAVE/LEAVE contain EVE)
&bull; NOAA -&gt; NOAH

And if this is the case, then my guess of {NOAA, NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT} was one away because NOAA belongs with the biblical names group, not the organizations group!

So the organizations group would be NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, and... who?
Maybe SUBARU? No, it's a Japanese company named after stars.

Unless the 4th organization is something else... or the category isn't organizations.

Wait, if NOAA is with the biblical names, then NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT need a 4th.

Or... what if NASA is also a biblical name? No.

Let me check: ABLE -&gt; ABEL, CANE -&gt; CAIN, EAVE -&gt; EVE, NOAA -&gt; NOAH. That's 4!

So the groups might be:
1. EQUIP, PREPARE, OUTFIT, READY (prepare) - CORRECT
2. ABLE, CANE, EAVE, NOAA (biblical names with minor spelling changes)
3. Then what about NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, and one other?

Remaining would be: GAME, DOWN, EAGER, SUBARU, NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, WILLING

If ABLE, CANE, EAVE, NOAA is correct, then from the remaining:
GAME, DOWN, EAGER, SUBARU, NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, WILLING

And we need 2 groups of 4.

What about NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, and... SUBARU?
All organizations/companies!

Or: GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING (all mean "willing/eager")
And: NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, SUBARU (all organizations/companies)

That works!

But wait, is SUBARU definitely an organization? It's a company, yes.

And GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING - all adjectives meaning willing to participate.

So my potential groups:
&bull; EQUIP, PREPARE, OUTFIT, READY (confirmed correct)
&bull; ABLE, CANE, EAVE, NOAA (hidden biblical names: Abel, Cain, Eve, Noah)
&bull; GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING (synonyms for willing/eager)
&bull; NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, SUBARU (organizations/companies)

But I need to verify. Is EAVE really meaning EVE? EAVE is short for eaves (overhang), and EVE is the name. It's a bit of a stretch, but "Eave" contains "Eve" or is one letter different from "Eve" if you remove the A? No, E-A-V-E vs E-V-E. You remove the A from EAVE to get EVE.

ABLE -&gt; ABEL (swap last two letters)
CANE -&gt; CAIN (change N to I... or N and I are nearby in alphabet)
NOAA -&gt; NOAH (change last A to H... A and H not nearby)

But A to H is changing one letter.

Actually:
&bull; ABLE: A-B-L-E -&gt; A-B-E-L (swap L and E) = ABEL ✓
&bull; CANE: C-A-N-E -&gt; C-A-I-N (change N to I) = CAIN ✓
&bull; EAVE: E-A-V-E -&gt; E-V-E (remove A, or change A to nothing and rearrange? No, just take E-V-E from positions 1,3,4? E-A-V-E, if you remove A you get EVE, or if you change A to V you get EVVE? No. Actually E-A-V-E: first letter E, third letter V, fourth letter E = EVE. Yes, the 1st, 3rd, and 4th letters are E-V-E.
&bull; NOAA: N-O-A-A -&gt; N-O-A-H (change last A to H) = NOAH ✓

Or for EAVE, you could say change A to nothing (delete A).

So yes, this works!

Therefore, my guess with NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT was one away because NOAA belongs with the biblical names, not with organizations.

So the actual organizations group is NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, and SUBARU.

Or... is SUBARU the odd one out and NASA is in the biblical name group? No, NASA doesn't become a biblical name easily.

Or is PARAMOUNT the odd one out, and the organizations are NASA, NOAA, N.F.L., SUBARU? But then where do ABLE, CANE, EAVE go?

No, the biblical name theory is too good to ignore.

So I should guess the biblical names next: ABLE, CANE, EAVE, NOAA.

Confidence: High, but let me double check if there's any other possibility.

Alternative: Could EAGER go with the biblical names? No.
Could WILLING? No.

And NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, SUBARU as organizations - this is solid. Three are American institutions, one is Japanese but still a major company/organization.

And GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING - all mean "willing to do something." GAME and DOWN are slang, EAGER and WILLING are standard. This is a mixed register group, which is common in Connections.

Actually, looking at the groups again:
&bull; Prepare verbs: EQUIP, PREPARE, OUTFIT, READY ✓
&bull; Biblical names: ABLE (Abel), CANE (Cain), EAVE (Eve), NOAA (Noah)
&bull; Slang/words for willing: GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING
&bull; Companies/Organizations: NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, SUBARU

Yes, this makes sense.

So my next guess should be the biblical names group.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
ABLE, CANE, EAVE, NOAA
&lt;/guess&gt;

Remaining words: GAME, DOWN, EAGER, SUBARU, NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, WILLING

From my previous analysis:
&bull; GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING = words meaning "willing/eager" (with GAME and DOWN being slang)
&bull; NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, SUBARU = organizations/companies

But let me verify these are correct.

For "willing/eager":
&bull; GAME: "I'm game" = I'm willing
&bull; DOWN: "I'm down" = I'm willing/in
&bull; EAGER: standard synonym for willing
&bull; WILLING: the word itself

This seems solid, though EAGER and WILLING are more standard while GAME and DOWN are slang.

For organizations:
&bull; NASA: government agency
&bull; N.F.L.: sports league
&bull; PARAMOUNT: entertainment company
&bull; SUBARU: car company (Japanese)

All are major organizations/companies. This works.

Are there any other possible groupings?

Could SUBARU fit elsewhere? It's the Pleiades star cluster in Japanese... NASA is space-related. But N.F.L. and PARAMOUNT aren't space-related.

Could there be a "___ League" or sports connection?
&bull; N.F.L. is a league
&bull; NBA, NHL, MLB... not here
&bull; Could work with others?

Could PARAMOUNT fit with movies/cinema? Yes, but others don't fit.

Could NASA, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, and... EAGER? No.

I think my two remaining groups are solid.

I'll guess the slang/words for "willing" next: GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
GAME, DOWN, EAGER, WILLING

2. <b>Hidden possessive pronouns</b> at the start of words:

Remaining words: BLUSH, PACE, SCORE, NOSE, RATE, STOCKINGS, RANK, MASCARA, SWEAT, DYE, FIDGET, GRADE

Now I need to find another group of 4.

Looking at the remaining words:
&bull; BLUSH, MASCARA, DYE, STOCKINGS? No, STOCKINGS doesn't fit with makeup...
&bull; Wait, things that can follow "BABY": BABY BLUSH? No...
&bull; Things that can precede a common word?

Let me think about "___ DROP":
&bull; SWEAT DROP? Not common
&bull; GRADE DROP? Yes
&bull; RATE DROP? Yes
&bull; SCORE DROP? Maybe not...

What about things that go with "NOSE"?
&bull; NOSE RING? Not in list
&bull; NOSE DIVE? Not in list
&bull; NOSE JOB? Not in list
&bull; RED NOSE? Not quite...

What about things that can precede "BAND"?
&bull; RUBBER BAND? Not in list
&bull; SWEAT BAND? Yes! SWEATBAND is a word.
&bull; RUBBER... wait

Let me think about words that can follow "EYE":
&bull; EYE DROPS? Not in list
&bull; MASCARA - that's for eyes
&bull; BLUSH - not really for eyes specifically
&bull; EYE SHADOW? Not in list

What about "___ RUN":
&bull; DYE RUN? Not really
&bull; NOSE RUN? Like a nose runny? Not really
&bull; BLUSH RUN? No

What about things associated with Santa or Christmas?
&bull; STOCKINGS (Christmas stockings)
&bull; NOSE (Rudolph's red nose)
&bull; BLUSH (rosy cheeks like Santa?)
&bull; Maybe not...

What about words that can follow "RED"?
&bull; RED NOSE (Rudolph)
&bull; RED BLUSH? Not really, blush is already red-ish
&bull; RED STOCKINGS? Yes, Red Stockings was a baseball team (Cincinnati Red Stockings/Reds)
&bull; RED DYE? Yes
&bull; RED SCORE? No

Wait, baseball teams or sports teams?
&bull; RED STOCKINGS (Cincinnati)
&bull; TIGER... but TIGER is already used
&bull; WHITE SOX? Not in list

What about things that can precede "BOMB"?
&bull; FIDGET BOMB? No
&bull; DYE BOMB? No

What about things you can do in a game or race?
&bull; PACE yourself
&bull; SCORE points
&bull; RANK
&bull; RATE?
&bull; GRADE?

Actually, looking at: PACE, SCORE, RANK, GRADE, RATE
These could all be things that evaluate or measure performance, or they could all precede or follow a word...

PACE, RATE, RANK, GRADE - these are all measures of evaluation or speed/performance metrics.

Or they could all precede "R":
&bull; PACE R? No
&bull; RATE R? No

Wait, what about words that can follow "HEART"?
&bull; HEART RATE - yes
&bull; HEART PACE? Not really, it's heartbeat
&bull; HEART SCORE? No

Let me think about compound words or phrases with body parts or things:

DYE, MASCARA, BLUSH, STOCKINGS?
&bull; These could all be things that are "RED"?
  - RED DYE
  - RED BLUSH (rosy/red blush)
  - RED MASCARA? Unusual
  - RED STOCKINGS

Or things associated with femininity or women's items? DYE (hair dye), MASCARA, BLUSH (makeup), STOCKINGS... that's a possible group: makeup/cosmetics and clothing? But STOCKINGS stands out.

Actually, what about things that can precede "BABY"?
&bull; BABY DYE? No
&bull; FIDGET BABY? No

What about "SNAKE":
&bull; GARTER SNAKE... STOCKINGS/GARTER?
&bull; Wait, GARTER SNAKE! And garters hold up STOCKINGS.

What about things + SNAKE?
&bull; GARTER SNAKE (garters and stockings related)
&bull; TIGER SNAKE? Yes, that's a snake
&bull; But TIGER is used

What about "_____ SNAKE":
&bull; GARTER snake (relates to STOCKINGS/garters)
&bull; Not helpful yet.

Let me reconsider. Words remaining: BLUSH, PACE, SCORE, NOSE, RATE, STOCKINGS, RANK, MASCARA, SWEAT, DYE, FIDGET, GRADE

What can follow "SWEAT"?
&bull; SWEAT GLAND? Not in list
&bull; SWEAT EQUITY? Not in list
&bull; SWEAT BAND? Not in list
&bull; SWEAT SHOP? Not in list

What can precede "SWEAT"?
&bull; COLD SWEAT? COLD isn't in list
&bull; SWEAT... wait

What about "BLOOD":
&bull; BLOOD RUSH/BLUSH? Blood rush makes you blush?
&bull; BLOOD DYE? No

What about things that can precede "DROP":
&bull; SWEAT DROP? Not common
&bull; GRADE DROP - yes
&bull; RATE DROP - yes
&bull; SCORE DROP - possible
&bull; PACE DROP? No

What about things that can follow "NOSE":
&bull; NOSE DIVE
&bull; NOSE RING
&bull; NOSE JOB

What about things that rhyme or sound like body parts?

Let me try "_____ RING":
&bull; NOSE RING
&bull; Not seeing others

What about "RED _____":
&bull; RED NOSE (Rudolph)
&bull; RED DYE
&bull; RED BLUSH? (Rosy red blush)
&bull; RED GRADE? No

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer connections?
&bull; RED NOSE
&bull; Could BLUSH be rosy cheeks like reindeer?
&bull; Not strong.

What about things that go with "HAIR":
&bull; HAIR DYE - yes
&bull; HAIR MASCARA? No, that's for eyelashes
&bull; HAIR CLIP? CLIP is already used

What about makeup/cosmetics: BLUSH, MASCARA, DYE (hair dye?), and... STOCKINGS? No. FIDGET? No.

Unless... things that can precede "BALL"?
&bull; FIDGET BALL? No, that's a spinner
&bull; NOSE BALL? No
&bull; SWEAT BALL? No

What about "_____ SPINNER":
&bull; FIDGET SPINNER - yes!

So FIDGET goes with SPINNER.

What else goes with SPINNER?
&bull; Not obvious.

Let me try a different approach. Words that can precede "BOMB":
&bull; FIDGET BOMB? No
&bull; DYE BOMB? No
&bull; SWEAT BOMB? No

Words that can follow "SUGAR":
&bull; SUGAR DADDY? Not in list

What about "_____ PLUM":
&bull; SUGAR PLUM? Not in list

Back to "_____ SNAKE":
&bull; GARTER SNAKE (relates to stockings/garters)
&bull; RATTLESNAKE? RATTLE not in list
&bull; Could STOCKINGS relate to GARTER, and GARTER SNAKE?

What about animals?
&bull; TIGER (used)
&bull; Could these be types of animals or animal-related?

What about "_____ CRAB":
&bull; FIDGET CRAB? No
&bull; HERMIT CRAB... no

Let me look at PACE, RATE, SPEED, TEMPO... wait, PACE and RATE are synonyms. GRADE, RANK, SCORE are also evaluation metrics.

Actually: PACE, RATE, RANK, GRADE - these are all ways to evaluate or measure, or they can all precede something?

Or they can all follow "AT ANY":
&bull; AT ANY RATE - yes
&bull; AT ANY PACE? Not really
&bull; AT ANY GRADE? No

What about "AT A _____":
&bull; AT A RATE
&bull; AT A PACE
&bull; AT A SNAIL'S PACE... 

PACE, RATE, TEMPO, SPEED - but only PACE and RATE are in the list.

Wait, what about words that can precede "R" or be followed by "S"?

Let me try "_____ CARD":
&bull; SCORE CARD - yes
&bull; RANK CARD? Not really
&bull; GRADE CARD? Report card, not grade card
&bull; RATE CARD? Yes, advertising rate card

SCORE CARD, RATE CARD... PACE CARD? Not really.

What about "_____ BOARD":
&bull; SCOREBOARD - yes
&bull; DASHBOARD... no

What about things + "KEEPER":
&bull; SCOREKEEPER - yes
&bull; RATEKEEPER? No
&bull; GRADEKEEPER? No

What about "_____DROB" or similar?

Let me reconsider the makeup angle. BLUSH, MASCARA are definitely makeup. DYE could be hair dye. What's the fourth?
&bull; STOCKINGS? No.
&bull; Could it be things that come in tubes or containers?

Or things you apply to your face/body?
&bull; BLUSH (face)
&bull; MASCARA (eyelashes)
&bull; DYE (hair)
&bull; STOCKINGS (legs) - you "apply" stockings?

That seems weak.

What about things associated with "RED"?
&bull; RED NOSE (Rudolph, drunk person)
&bull; RED DYE
&bull; RED BLUSH (cheeks turn red)
&bull; RED GRADE? No
&bull; RED RANK? No
&bull; RED PACE? No

RED NOSE, RED DYE, RED BLUSH... and RED... STOCKINGS? The Cincinnati Red Stockings!

Or things that can be "RUNNING":
&bull; RUNNING NOSE - yes (runny nose)
&bull; RUNNING PACE? Not really
&bull; RUNNING SCORE? Not really
&bull; RUNNING RATE? No

RUNNY NOSE... what else is RUNNY?
&bull; RUNNY DYE? No
&bull; RUNNY MASCARA? Yes! When you cry, mascara runs.
&bull; RUNNY BLUSH? Not really
&bull; RUNNY STOCKINGS? No

Wait, things that RUN:
&bull; NOSE runs
&bull; MASCARA runs (when crying)
&bull; DYE runs (in the wash, color runs)
&bull; STOCKINGS run? YES! When you get a run in your stockings (a snag that runs)!

That's a great category! Things that can RUN or get a RUN in them:
&bull; RUNNY NOSE / NOSE runs
&bull; MASCARA runs (down your face when crying)
&bull; DYE runs (in the laundry)
&bull; STOCKINGS get a run (ladder/run in stockings)

Or more precisely: NOSE, MASCARA, DYE, STOCKINGS - all things that can "RUN" (as in, have a run in them, or run down).

Let me verify:
&bull; Runny nose - yes
&bull; Mascara runs - yes (colloquial)
&bull; Dye runs - yes (color bleeds/runs)
&bull; Stockings run - yes (get a run/ladder)

This is a solid category!

Remaining after that would be: BLUSH, PACE, SCORE, RATE, RANK, SWEAT, FIDGET, GRADE

And we already used CLIP, TRAIL, TIGER, TOWEL.

So my next guess is: NOSE, MASCARA, DYE, STOCKINGS (things that run)
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
NOSE, MASCARA, DYE, STOCKINGS
&lt;/guess&gt;

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.

4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

Remaining patterns to verify after this:

Looking for strong groups:

Male animals (specific terms):
&bull; BUCK (male deer/rabbit)
&bull; BILLY (male goat)
&bull; JACK (male donkey)
&bull; RAM (male sheep)

This is a very solid, specific category.

That leaves: ZING, ZEST, PUNCH, KICK, SOLO, FREE, SINGLE, STAG

Which neatly divides into:

Alone/unaccompanied:

The remaining four words must form the final group: SOLO, FREE, SINGLE, STAG

This makes perfect sense - all mean "unaccompanied" or "without a partner," especially in a social/dating context:
&bull; SOLO: alone, unaccompanied
&bull; FREE: unattached, not in a relationship
&bull; SINGLE: not married or in a committed relationship
&bull; STAG: specifically "going stag" means attending an event without a date

&bull; SWEET, KIND, TENDER, WARM - These could all precede "HEART" (sweetheart, kind-hearted/tender-hearted, warm-hearted). Or they could all describe personality types.

Actually, looking more carefully at the "___HEART" connection:
&bull; SWEETHEART (one word)
&bull; KIND heart
&bull; TENDER heart
&bull; WARM heart

But FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW - these could all go with "AWAY" as in:
&bull; Fiddle away (time)
&bull; Fritter away (time/money)
&bull; Trifle away? Not common... 
&bull; Throw away

Wait, looking at the words again: FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, and... maybe there's another pattern.

Actually, looking at the food angle:
&bull; FRITTER (apple fritter, etc.)
&bull; KETTLE (kettle corn)
&bull; Could these be types of corn? No, Fritter isn't corn.

Let me reconsider the popcorn connection:
&bull; KETTLE (kettle corn)
&bull; STOVETOP (stovetop popcorn)
&bull; MICROWAVE (microwave popcorn)
&bull; POPPER (popcorn popper)

That's a strong category!

Then SWEET, KIND, TENDER, WARM would be the "___HEART" or personality adjectives.

And FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW... 
&bull; FIDDLE with
&bull; FRITTER away
&bull; TRIFLE with
&bull; THROW away

Or could they all precede something else?

Actually, thinking about "___ AWAY":
&bull; FIDDLE away (time)
&bull; FRITTER away (time/money)
&bull; THROW away (trash)

TRIFLE doesn't fit "away" well.

Could they all follow "BRAIN"?
&bull; Brain fritter? No.
&bull; Brain fart? No.

Could they all precede "CORN"?
&bull; Kettle corn - YES
&bull; But the others don't work.

Let me think about "___ POPCORN":
&bull; Kettle popcorn? Not really, it's kettle corn.
&bull; Stovetop popcorn - YES
&bull; Microwave popcorn - YES
&bull; Popper - refers to the device, not really "popper popcorn"

But "KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, POPPER" as methods of making popcorn is very strong.

Then SWEET, KIND, TENDER, WARM as descriptors for people/hearts.

Then FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW... 

Wait, could FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, and maybe something else go with a food theme?
&bull; Fritter is food
&bull; Trifle is a dessert (British)
&bull; Sweet could be food
&bull; Tender could describe meat

But I already used SWEET in the personality group potentially.

Let me reconsider. If KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, POPPER is one group (popcorn preparation), and SWEET, KIND, TENDER, WARM is another (___HEART adjectives), then:

Remaining: FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW

These could all be verbs meaning to waste or treat carelessly:
&bull; FIDDLE (fiddle with, fiddle around)
&bull; FRITTER (fritter away)
&bull; TRIFLE (trifle with)
&bull; THROW (throw away, throw around)

Or they could all precede or follow a specific word.

Actually, could they all precede "AWAY"?
&bull; Fiddle away? Not common.
&bull; Fritter away - YES
&bull; Trifle away? Not really.
&bull; Throw away - YES

Could they follow "BRAIN"?
&bull; Brain fritter? No.
&bull; Brain freeze? No.

Could they all be things you do with time?
&bull; Fritter away time
&bull; Throw away time? Not really.

Let me think... could they go with "CORN"?
&bull; Kettle corn - YES
&bull; But that's taking from the popcorn group.

Actually, looking at the NYT Connections style, often there's a "___ CORN" category or similar.

Words that can precede "CORN":
&bull; KETTLE (kettle corn)
&bull; SWEET (sweet corn)
&bull; POPPER (popper corn? No, popcorn popper)
&bull; Not really working.

Words that follow "CORN":
&bull; CORN fritter? Yes!
&bull; CORN popper? Not really.

Let me try: "___ FISH"?
&bull; FIDDLE - no
&bull; Not working.

Back to the strong categories:
1. KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, POPPER - Popcorn making methods (very strong)
2. SWEET, KIND, TENDER, WARM - ___HEART adjectives (very strong)
3. FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW - These all can mean to waste or treat lightly, or they all can precede a specific word?

Actually, could they all precede "STICK"?
&bull; Fiddlestick? Yes (fiddlesticks!)
&bull; Fritter stick? Not really.
&bull; Trifle stick? No.
&bull; Throw stick? No.

Could they precede "AWAY" as verbs?
&bull; Fritter away - YES
&bull; Throw away - YES
&bull; Trifle with - not away
&bull; Fiddle with - not away

Could they follow "BRAIN"?
&bull; Brain fritter - no
&bull; Brain freeze - no

Could they all precede "CORN"?
&bull; Kettle corn - YES
&bull; Sweet corn - YES  
&bull; Fritter... no, that's made of corn maybe but not "fritter corn"

Wait, could SWEET, KETTLE, something, something all be types of corn?
&bull; Sweet corn
&bull; Kettle corn
&bull; Indian corn? Not in list.
&bull; Pop corn? Not in list as "POP", but we have "POPPER"

What if the category is "Types of corn" or words that go with CORN?
&bull; SWEET (sweet corn)
&bull; KETTLE (kettle corn)  
&bull; INDIAN (not in list)
&bull; CREAMED (not in list)

Not working.

Let me reconsider. Maybe the popcorn group is wrong.

What about: FIDDLE, KETTLE, something, something - all types of something?

Or: SWEET, TENDER, KIND, WARM - could these all describe meat or food?
&bull; Sweet meat? Not really.
&bull; Tender meat - YES
&bull; Warm? Not really for meat specifically.

Back to ___HEART - this is very strong for SWEET, KIND, TENDER, WARM.

And KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, POPPER as popcorn methods is also strong.

Then FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW must be the last group.

What connects FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW?

They all can mean to waste time or resources:
&bull; Fritter away
&bull; Throw away
&bull; Trifle with (time)
&bull; Fiddle with (time)

But more specifically, in NYT Connections, they might all go with a specific word.

Could they all precede "STICK"?
&bull; Fiddlestick - YES (and "fiddlesticks!" as an exclamation)
&bull; Fritterstick? Not common.
&bull; Trifle stick? No.

Could they follow "BRAIN"?
&bull; Brain fritter? No.

Could they precede "CORN"?
&bull; No.

Could they all be verbs that mean "to toy with" or "waste"?
&bull; Fiddle with
&bull; Trifle with  
&bull; Fritter away
&bull; Throw away

Hmm, different prepositions.

Wait - could they all precede "AWAY"?
&bull; Fiddle away (regional/slang?)
&bull; Fritter away - YES
&bull; Trifle away (rare but possible?)
&bull; Throw away - YES

Not perfect.

Could they follow "CORN"?
&bull; Kettle corn (KETTLE is in this group potentially)
&bull; But if KETTLE is with the popcorn group...

Let me reconsider the groups entirely.

Words: FIDDLE, SWEET, POPPER, STOVETOP, FRITTER, KIND, TRIFLE, THROW, TENDER, WARM, KETTLE, MICROWAVE

Group 1 (appendages): ARM, FIN, FLIPPER, WING - DONE

Possible groups:
&bull; SWEET, TENDER, KIND, WARM (adjectives for nice people)
&bull; KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, POPPER (popcorn makers)
&bull; FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW (??)
&bull; Or maybe FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE and one other are foods?
  - Fritter (food)
  - Trifle (dessert)
  - Sweet (dessert/candy)
  - But Tender? No.
  - Popper? Jalapeño popper! Yes!
  - Corn popper? Not a food.
  - Kettle? No.

Jalapeño POPPER is a food.
Fritter is a food.
Trifle is a food.
Sweet could be a food (British for candy).

But that's weak for SWEET.

What about: POPPER, FRITTER, TRIFLE, KETTLE?
&bull; Jalapeño popper
&bull; Apple fritter  
&bull; Trifle (dessert)
&bull; Kettle... chips? Kettle cooked?

KETTLE could go with chips (kettle chips).

Then: STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, and what?
&bull; Stovetop stuffing? Yes!
&bull; Microwave... meal?
&bull; Not strong.

Actually: STOVETOP stuffing is a specific brand.
KETTLE chips is a brand/style.
Could these all be brands?
&bull; Stovetop (Kraft)
&bull; Kettle (chips brand)
&bull; Not really for others.

Let me go with my strongest hypothesis for guess 2:
KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, POPPER as popcorn preparation methods.

This leaves: FIDDLE, SWEET, FRITTER, KIND, TRIFLE, THROW, TENDER, WARM

Then SWEET, KIND, TENDER, WARM for the next group.

Then FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW.

What connects FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW?

They can all mean to waste:
&bull; Fritter away (time/money)
&bull; Throw away (trash/time)
&bull; Trifle with (time/opportunities)
&bull; Fiddle with (time)

Or they all precede a word?

Actually, could they all precede "STICK"?
&bull; Fiddlestick - yes
&bull; Throw stick - yes (a stick you throw for a dog)
&bull; Fritter stick? Not really.
&bull; Trifle stick? No.

Could they follow "BRAIN"?
&bull; Brain fritter? No.

Could they all be anagrams? No.

Could they all precede "CORN"?
&bull; Sweet corn
&bull; Kettle corn  
&bull; Fritter corn? No.

Wait, I have a new idea. Could SWEET, KETTLE, TENDER, and something all modify a word?

Or: Words that can follow "BRAIN"?
&bull; Brain freeze - no
&bull; Brain fart - no
&bull; Brain fritter? No.

Let me search for "trifle throw fiddle fritter connection".

They might all go with "AWAY" despite my hesitation:
&bull; Fritter away
&bull; Throw away  
&bull; Trifle away (actually, "trifle away" is used in literature, though rare)
&bull; Fiddle away (used in phrases like "fiddle away the hours")

Or they might all mean "to waste."

Given that I need to guess, and KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, POPPER is very strong for popcorn, I'll go with that.

Confidence: 0.90
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
KETTLE, STOVETOP, MICROWAVE, POPPER

Clear groups:
&bull; SWEET, KIND, TENDER, WARM: All adjectives describing a loving/nice personality, and all can precede "HEART" (sweetheart, kind heart, tender heart, warm heart). This is a very strong category.
&bull; FIDDLE, FRITTER, TRIFLE, THROW: All verbs meaning to waste time or resources, and/or can combine with "AWAY" (fritter away, throw away, trifle away, fiddle away).

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

1. <b>Disney Princesses</b>: ARIEL (Little Mermaid), AURORA (Sleeping Beauty), TIANA (Princess and the Frog), MERIDA (Brave) - all official Disney Princess characters.

2. <b>Microsoft Fonts</b>: VERDANA, GEORGIA, ARIAL, IMPACT - all well-known fonts distributed with Windows/Microsoft products.

4. <b>Gymnastics Moves</b>: ARABESQUE (pose), ROUNDOFF (cartwheel variant), SPLIT (pose), AERIAL (no-hands cartwheel) - all specific gymnastics skills.

Each word fits cleanly into one group with no overlaps. The homophone possibility (ARIAL/AERIAL/ARIEL/AREAL) is tempting but AREAL fits better with measurement terms (linear/areal/volumetric/angular progression), and AERIAL works perfectly as a gymnastics term.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

2. ENTRANCES/OPENINGS: DOOR, GATE, HATCH, PORTAL

2. <b>Restaurant seating areas</b>: BAR, BOOTH, COUNTER, TABLE - places to sit in a restaurant/bar.

3. <b>Touchscreen gestures</b>: TAP, SWIPE, PINCH, SCROLL - actions performed on smartphone/tablet screens.

4. <b>Add "S" to make new words</b>: ALE→SALE, EEK→SEEK, HIVE→SHIVE, QUASH→SQUASH - words that become different words when S is added to the front.

Now I need to find the remaining 3 groups of 4 words each from the remaining words:
CHEST, GROUNDS, GREEN, LAWN, CHAIR, HAZEL, HEAD, DIRECTOR, CHIEF, PEA, COCO, FIELD

Possible groups I see:
1. Leadership positions/titles: CHAIR, CHIEF, DIRECTOR, HEAD (as in "head of the department", "chair of the board", etc.)
2. Types of nuts: CHEST (chestnut), HAZEL (hazelnut), COCO (coconut), PEA (peanut) - though PEA is technically a legume, it's often grouped with nuts in word puzzles
3. Grassy areas: GROUNDS, GREEN, LAWN, FIELD

Let me verify these groupings:
&bull; Leadership: CHAIR (chairperson), CHIEF (chief executive), DIRECTOR (director of...), HEAD (head of school/department) - this works well
&bull; Nuts: CHEST (chestnut), HAZEL (hazelnut), COCO (coconut), PEA (peanut) - this is a classic "___ nut" pattern
&bull; Grassy areas: GROUNDS (groundskeeper), GREEN (putting green), LAWN (lawn care), FIELD (field of grass) - these all refer to grassy areas or lawns

This accounts for all 12 remaining words perfectly. 

I should pick one of these groups. The "___ NUT" group seems very strong (CHESTNUT, HAZELNUT, COCONUT, PEANUT). Or the leadership titles. Or the grassy areas.

I'll go with the nuts group since it's a very clear word association pattern.

Remaining words: GROUNDS, GREEN, LAWN, FIELD

These are all words for grassy areas or lawns. Let me verify:
&bull; GROUNDS: often refers to lawns/estate grounds
&bull; GREEN: as in putting green or village green (grassy common area)
&bull; LAWN: self-explanatory
&bull; FIELD: can be a grassy area, though sometimes implies crops or sports

Actually, thinking about it more carefully - these could also go with "KEEPER":
&bull; GROUNDSKEEPER
&bull; GREENKEEPER (golf term)
&bull; LAWNKEEPER? (not common)
&bull; FIELD... not really

Or they could all precede a word or follow a word. Let me think...

Actually, looking at them as "___" something:
&bull; CRICKET GROUNDS, GROUNDSKEEPER
&bull; PUTTING GREEN, VILLAGE GREEN, GREENKEEPER
&bull; LAWN... LAWN CHAIR (but CHAIR is used), LAWN MOWER, FRONT LAWN
&bull; FIELD... FIELD HOCKEY, FIELD TRIP

Or they could all be types of areas where sports are played? Or all can precede "KEEPER" (groundskeeper, greenkeeper... not sure about lawnkeeper or fieldkeeper).

Actually, thinking about it - these might all be things that can follow "KEEPER" or precede "CARE" or something similar.

Let me reconsider - they could all be:
&bull; GROUNDS (sports grounds)
&bull; GREEN (bowling green, putting green)
&bull; LAWN (lawn tennis, lawn bowling)
&bull; FIELD (field hockey, football field)

These are all surfaces where sports are played! Or more specifically, they are all types of playing surfaces for sports.

Actually, the most straightforward category is just "grassy areas" or "types of lawns/grassy surfaces."

But wait - could they all precede a specific word? Like "___ TENNIS"?
&bull; LAWN TENNIS ✓
&bull; Not GROUNDS TENNIS
&bull; Not GREEN TENNIS (though there is Real Tennis played on different surfaces)

Could they follow "CARE"?
&bull; LAWN CARE ✓
&bull; FIELD CARE? (not common)
&bull; GROUNDS CARE? (maybe)
&bull; GREEN CARE? (not really)

Could they precede "KEEPER"?
&bull; GROUNDSKEEPER ✓
&bull; GREENKEEPER ✓ (golf term)
&bull; LAWNKEEPER? (not really used)
&bull; FIELDKEEPER? (not really)

Hmm, let me think about what word could follow all of them...

Actually, I think the simplest and most likely answer is that they are all "types of grassy areas" or "surfaces where sports are played."

But there's another possibility - could they all go with "___ BALL"?
&bull; LAWN BALL? (lawn bowling uses balls, but it's not "lawn ball")
&bull; FIELD BALL? (field hockey uses a ball, but...)

Or "___ GAME"?
&bull; FIELD GAME ✓
&bull; LAWN GAME ✓ (croquet, etc.)
&bull; GROUNDS... not really

Let me reconsider the "KEEPER" angle more carefully. In British English:
&bull; GROUNDSKEEPER ✓
&bull; GREENKEEPER ✓ (maintains the putting green)
&bull; Could LAWN be LAWNKEEPER? Not really common.
&bull; FIELDKEEPER? Not really.

Actually, thinking about golf:
&bull; GREEN (putting green)
&bull; Could GROUNDS work? Not specifically.
&bull; FAIRWAY is the word usually used.

Wait - could they all precede "BOWLING"?
&bull; LAWN BOWLING ✓
&bull; Not GROUNDS BOWLING
&bull; Not GREEN BOWLING
&bull; Not FIELD BOWLING

Could they follow "VILLAGE"?
&bull; VILLAGE GREEN ✓
&bull; Not VILLAGE GROUNDS (maybe?)
&bull; Not VILLAGE LAWN
&bull; Not VILLAGE FIELD

Hmm, could they all precede "CARE"?
&bull; LAWN CARE is very common
&bull; FIELD CARE (agricultural term, maybe)
&bull; GREEN CARE? (maybe for golf greens)
&bull; GROUNDS CARE (landscaping term)

Actually, looking at this fresh - these might all be words that can follow "SPORTS":
&bull; SPORTS GROUNDS ✓
&bull; SPORTS... not really for the others.

Or types of "___ TENNIS"?
&bull; LAWN TENNIS ✓
&bull; FIELD TENNIS? No.
&bull; GREEN TENNIS? No.

Let me try "___ MAINTENANCE" or "___ WORK":
&bull; GROUNDS MAINTENANCE ✓
&bull; GREEN MAINTENANCE (golf course maintenance)
&bull; LAWN MAINTENANCE ✓
&bull; FIELD MAINTENANCE ✓ (sports field maintenance)

That could work, but it's a bit loose.

Actually, I think I might be overthinking this. The most straightforward category is simply that they are all types of grassy areas or lawns. GROUNDS, GREEN, LAWN, and FIELD can all refer to manicured grassy areas, particularly in the context of estates, parks, or sports facilities.

&bull; The grounds of a mansion
&bull; The village green
&bull; The front lawn
&bull; The sports field

Yes, this seems like the most likely category. They are all synonyms for "grassy area" or "lawn."

Alternatively, could they all precede "BALL"?
&bull; LAWN BOWLING BALL? No.
&bull; FIELD BALL? Not really.
&bull; GROUNDS BALL? No.
&bull; GREEN BALL? In snooker/pool there is a green ball, but that's different.

Or follow "BOWLING"?
&bull; LAWN BOWLING ✓
&bull; GREEN BOWLING? No, but bowling greens are a thing... wait.

BOWLING GREEN! That's a thing. And LAWN BOWLING is a sport.

Actually:
&bull; BOWLING GREEN ✓ (the surface used for lawn bowling)
&bull; Could you have a BOWLING FIELD? Not really.
&bull; BOWLING GROUNDS? Not really.
&bull; BOWLING LAWN? Not really, though "lawn bowling" is the sport.

Hmm, what about "___KEEPER"?
&bull; GROUNDSKEEPER ✓
&bull; GREENKEEPER ✓ (British term for golf course maintenance)
&bull; LAWNKEEPER? Not common, but "lawn keeper" might be used occasionally?
&bull; FIELDKEEPER? Not common.

Actually, looking at British English terms for golf:
&bull; GREENKEEPER is definitely a word.

What about "CARE"?
&bull; LAWN CARE ✓ (very common)
&bull; FIELD CARE (agricultural)
&bull; GREEN CARE (golf course industry term)
&bull; GROUNDS CARE (landscaping industry term)

These all work as "___ CARE" services!

But I think the most likely intended answer is simply that they are all words meaning "grassy area" or they are all types of surfaces where outdoor sports are played.

Given the remaining words are exactly these four, and the pattern of the previous groups (Tarantino movies, types of nuts, leadership titles), the fourth group is likely either:
1. Grassy areas/surfaces
2. Words that can follow "___KEEPER" (groundskeeper, greenkeeper... though lawnkeeper and fieldkeeper are weak)
3. Words that can precede "CARE" (lawn care, field care, green care, grounds care)

Actually, wait. Could they all precede a specific word?
&bull; HOME GROUNDS? (British sports term)
&bull; HOME FIELD? (home field advantage)
&bull; HOME GREEN? Not really.
&bull; HOME LAWN? Yes, but not as idiomatic as "home field."

Or types of "___ TURF"?
&bull; Not really for any of them specifically.

Let me go with the simplest explanation: they are all types of grassy areas or lawns. Or they all can precede "CARE" which is a services category.

Given that "LAWN CARE" is extremely common, "FIELD CARE" is used in agriculture, "GREEN CARE" is used in golf course maintenance, and "GROUNDS CARE" is a landscaping term, I think "___ CARE" might be the intended answer.

But honestly, "grassy areas" or "types of lawns" is the most natural category.

Let me guess: GROUNDS, GREEN, LAWN, FIELD as types of grassy areas/lawns.
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
GROUNDS, GREEN, LAWN, FIELD

Potential categories I see:

1. <b>U.S. Cabinet Departments</b>: STATE (State Department), ENERGY (Energy Department), LABOR (Labor Department), JUSTICE (Justice Department). This is a very strong, clean category.

2. <b>Bedding items</b>: BLANKET, SHEET, SHAM (pillow sham), THROW (as in a throw blanket). These are all types of bedding/linens.

3. <b>Actions in card games</b>: DISCARD, DRAW, PASS, PLAY. These are all things you do with playing cards.

4. <b>Words meaning to uphold/fulfill (a promise, law, or obligation)</b>: FULFILL, HONOR, KEEP, UPHOLD. You fulfill a promise, honor an agreement, keep your word, uphold the law.

This accounts for all 16 words perfectly. The Cabinet Departments category is the most unambiguous and distinct, so I'll start with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

3. <b>Words meaning to uphold/fulfill</b>: FULFILL, HONOR, KEEP, UPHOLD (fulfill a promise, honor an agreement, keep your word, uphold the law)

I should pick one of these remaining categories. The card game one (DISCARD, DRAW, PASS, PLAY) is very clean and specific. The bedding one (BLANKET, SHEET, SHAM, THROW) is also very clean. The "uphold" one (FULFILL, HONOR, KEEP, UPHOLD) is good too but maybe slightly more abstract.

I'll go with the card game actions as it's very distinct. DISCARD, DRAW, PASS, PLAY.

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

3. <b>___ Rabbit (famous rabbits)</b>: VELVETEEN (Velveteen Rabbit), WHITE (White Rabbit), ROGER (Roger Rabbit), TRIX (Trix cereal mascot rabbit). All famous rabbits!

4. <b>Things that come in 12/dozens</b>: ROSE (dozen roses), JUROR (12 jurors on a jury), MONTH (12 months), DONUT (dozen donuts). All commonly associated with the number 12.
