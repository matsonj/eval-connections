1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

Let's look at the other potential groups:
1. American Automakers: DODGE, FORD, LINCOLN, RAM. This is a very solid group. If DODGE is an auto brand, that breaks the dodgeball group.
2. Words that follow "Sky": SKYSCRAPER, SKYROCKET, SKYLARK... we need a fourth. SKYDIVE fits perfectly. If DIVE is used here, the dodgeball group is further dismantled.
3. This leaves DUCK, DIP, and several other words: CHIP, FRY, STAR, WING, SENATOR, FLYER.
4. Looking at the capitalized sports teams, we can find singular names of NHL team mascots: Anaheim DUCK, Philadelphia FLYER, Ottawa SENATOR, and Dallas STAR. (Houston Rockets is NBA, and Detroit Red Wings traditionally includes "Red").
5. The remaining words are CHIP, DIP, FRY, WING. These group together perfectly as quintessential party snacks, bar appetizers, or finger foods.

1. HAN, MING, SONG, TANG are very clearly names of famous Chinese Dynasties. This group is airtight.
2. We then look at PUNCH, ZING, ZEST, KICK, and TANG. These all share a meaning of "a flavorful bite" or "oomph." Since TANG fits perfectly with the dynasties, we can safely pull it out, leaving us with exactly four for the "flavorful bite" or "piquancy" group: PUNCH, ZING, ZEST, KICK.
3. Looking at the remaining words, we notice several male animals: BUCK, RAM, BILLY, JACK, and STAG. Since we have 5, we must look for to see which one belongs to another category.
4. The remaining words are FREE, SOLO, SINGLE, along with the need to steal one from the "male animals". STAG is a perfect fit here, as doing something "stag" means "going alone", pairing flawlessly with FREE, SOLO, and SINGLE to form an "alone, unaccompanied, or unattached status" category.

This resolves the board neatly with no ambiguous stragglers! I'll guess the Chinese dynasties first, as it's an unmistakable trivia category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Those remaining will be male animals (BUCK, RAM, BILLY, JACK) and words meaning unaccompanied or unattached (STAG, SINGLE, SOLO, FREE - as in single and free to mingle).

We have 5 potential male animals, so one needs to go to the other group consisting of FREE, SOLO, and SINGLE. 
Looking at those three words, they all describe being alone, unattached, or without a partner. STAG fits this perfectly (e.g., attending a party or wedding "stag" means going without a date). "Single", "Solo", and "Free" also mean unaccompanied or romantically unattached.

1. Male animals: BILLY, BUCK, JACK, RAM

First, I notice there are several words starting with the prefix "WOOD": WOODSTOCK, WOODCHUCK, WOODEN, WOODY, and the word WOOD itself. This is a deliberate trap (5 words). Let's see how they fit into separate concepts.

1. <b>Adjectives for Unnatural/Forced:</b> "WOODEN" perfectly matches the adjectives "AWKWARD", "STIFF", and "STILTED". They all describe a rigid or ungraceful manner/performance. 
2. <b>Cartoon Birds:</b> "WOODY" (Woodpecker), "WOODSTOCK" (Snoopy's yellow bird companion), "FOGHORN" (Leghorn), and "SCROOGE" (McDuck) are all famous fictional cartoon birds.
3. <b>Tongue Twister Nouns/Verbs:</b> "How much WOOD WOULD a WOODCHUCK CHUCK if a woodchuck COULD CHUCK WOOD." The remaining words fitting this are "WOOD", "WOODCHUCK", "CHUCK", and "COULD".
4. <b>Number Homophones:</b> We are left with exactly four seemingly unrelated words: "THEREFORE", "CLASSICS", "CREATE", and "GUTHRIE". Looking closely at their syllables and sounds, each perfectly ends in a number homophone:
&bull; Gu-THREE (3)
&bull; There-FOUR (4)
&bull; Clas-SIX (6)
&bull; Cre-EIGHT (8)

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

Let's analyze the potential groupings. 

First, I notice there's a very clever trap: words that sound like colors.
&bull; BLEW (Blue)
&bull; CHORAL (Coral)
&bull; READ (Red)
&bull; WIGHT (White)

If we were to group these 4 together as "Color homophones", we'd be left with 12 words:
&bull; AMERICANA, JAZZ, RAP (3 words related to music genres)
&bull; BURST, BROKE, SPLIT (3 words meaning ruptured/failed structurally)
&bull; CALL, DIVINE, FORECAST (3 words meaning to predict or foresee)
&bull; SHADE, SPECTER, SPIRIT (3 words meaning ghosts or apparitions)

Notice how the leftover words naturally form triplets. This implies that the "Color homophones" category is a brilliantly designed red herring crafted by taking exactly one word away from each of the actual four categories! 

Let's restore the missing 4th words to check the real categories:
1. Ghosts/Apparitions: SHADE, SPECTER, SPIRIT, plus WIGHT (a wight is a ghostly/undead being).
2. Predict/Foretell: CALL, DIVINE, FORECAST, plus READ (as in "read the future" or "call an outcome").
3. Music Genres: AMERICANA, JAZZ, RAP, plus CHORAL.
4. Exploded/Ruptured: BURST, BROKE, SPLIT, plus BLEW (e.g., "the tire blew/burst/split").

This structure perfectly accounts for all 16 words without leaving any awkward remainders. I will submit the "Ghosts" category first as it is remarkably distinct and the inclusion of "WIGHT" confirms it beyond doubt.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
SHADE, SPECTER, SPIRIT, WIGHT

First, I notice several words that sound like names from the Book of Genesis in the Bible:
&bull; ABLE sounds like Abel
&bull; CANE sounds like Cain
&bull; EAVE sounds like Eve
&bull; NOAA sounds like Noah
These four (ABLE, CANE, EAVE, NOAA) clearly form a "Biblical homophones" category.

Second, I have the words SUBARU, NASA, PARAMOUNT, and N.F.L. 
What do these entities have in common? They all feature stars prominently in their logos!
&bull; Subaru: the Pleiades star cluster (6 stars).
&bull; Paramount: the iconic mountain surrounded by a halo of stars (22 stars).
&bull; N.F.L.: the shield logo features 8 stars (originally 50) representing the divisions.
&bull; NASA: the "meatball" logo has white stars scattered in the blue background.

Third, the words DOWN, EAGER, GAME, and WILLING all mean being enthusiastic, agreeable, or "up for" a plan or activity (e.g., "I'm game," "I'm down," "I'm willing", "I'm eager").

Finally, the remaining words are EQUIP, OUTFIT, PREPARE, and READY. These are all verbs that mean to furnish, provision, or make someone/something ready for a task or event. (READY acts as a verb here, whereas EAGER cannot be a verb, solidifying its place in the previous group).

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.

1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.
