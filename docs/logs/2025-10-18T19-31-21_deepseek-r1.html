- TRACK means to follow the trail or monitor movement.
This group forms a coherent category often seen in Connections puzzles. While some words have multiple meanings (e.g., MONITOR can be a noun for a screen), the verbal sense dominates here. The other words don't fit this category as well, though SQUID could loosely relate to tracking in sonar contexts. Confidence is high because this category is straightforward, but I considered alternative groupings (e.g., ink-related: PRINTER, TATTOO MACHINE, PEN, SQUID for squid ink) which didn't seem as strong for a first guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The remaining words are: SQUID, PRINTER, MONTH, TATTOO MACHINE, DONUT, TRIX, PEN, ROGER, WHITE, VELVETEEN, JUROR, ROSE.

I focused on identifying the next category by analyzing connections:
- A strong thematic link emerged around "ink": 
  - SQUID: Known for producing ink as a defense mechanism.
  - PRINTER: A device that uses ink for printing.
  - TATTOO MACHINE: A tool that injects ink into the skin for tattoos.
  - PEN: A writing instrument that dispenses ink.
This grouping is cohesive and commonly appears in Connections puzzles as a category like "things that use or produce ink."

I considered alternatives but found them less convincing:
- Food items (DONUT, TRIX, SQUID, ROSE): Too weak; SQUID is primarily an animal, TRIX is cereal, and ROSE is not strongly food-related despite uses like rose water. No fourth clear food candidate (e.g., DONUT fits, but PRINTER doesn't).
- Colors (WHITE, ROSE): Only two clear candidates; ROSE can be a color, but VELVETEEN is a fabric, not a color.
- Proper names (ROGER, ROSE): Only two candidates; JUROR and TRIX don't fit naturally.
- Time (MONTH): Lacks other time-related words (e.g., YEAR or WEEK); ROSE as past tense of "rise" isn't a time unit.
- Fabric (VELVETEEN): Only one clear candidate; no group forms.

The ink category has high confidence due to clear, unambiguous associations. Secondary groups might emerge later (e.g., DONUT and TRIX as food), but for now, this is the strongest option with four clear matches.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I need to find a group of four related words. After analysis, I noticed a strong theme involving fictional rabbits:  
- TRIX: Refers to the Trix Rabbit, the mascot for Trix cereal.  
- ROGER: Refers to Roger Rabbit, the cartoon character from "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."  
- VELVETEEN: Refers to the Velveteen Rabbit, the protagonist of the children's book "The Velveteen Rabbit."  
- WHITE: Refers to the White Rabbit from "Alice in Wonderland" (character and cultural reference).  
This category fits well as "fictional rabbits" or "__ Rabbit" phrases, a common type in Connections puzzles. The cultural references are unambiguous and consistent.  

I considered other groupings but they were weaker:  
- DONUT, TRIX, ROSE: Food-related? DONUT and TRIX (cereal) are edibles, but ROSE is not primarily food (although used in some contexts), and no fourth word fits—MONTH and JUROR don't belong.  
- JUROR, ROGER: Legal? JUROR is court-related, but ROGER (as a name or radio term) doesn't fit cleanly, and others like WHITE or MONTH aren't legal terms.  
- Colors: WHITE and ROSE (as rose color) are possible, but only two; VELVETEEN is a fabric, not a color, so incomplete.  
- Other themes like time (MONTH) or verbs (ROSE as past tense) lack support.  

This rabbit theme is the most cohesive group, though confidence is not absolute because WHITE relies on inference as part of "White Rabbit." However, such wordplay is typical in Connections. The remaining words (MONTH, DONUT, JUROR, ROSE) will likely form a fourth category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- **JUROR**: A standard jury has 12 jurors in many jurisdictions.
- **ROSE**: Often sold in dozens (e.g., a dozen roses = 12 roses).

This category ("things that come in twelves/dozens") is logical and aligns with known Connections puzzle themes. I considered alternatives, like temporal terms (only MONTH fits) or floral/legal terms (only ROSE/JUROR fit partially), but none formed a complete group. With no other cohesive categories possible, this is the clear final group. Confidence is very high given the precise thematic link.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, I notice a strong cluster of words related to camera brands: FUJIFILM, OLYMPUS, HASSELBLAD, and POLAROID. All four are well-known companies in photography, making this a plausible category. FUJIFILM and POLAROID are associated with film and instant cameras, OLYMPUS with digital cameras, and HASSELBLAD with high-end medium format cameras. This group seems cohesive and distinct from other words.

Other potential categories exist but are less certain at this stage:
- Italian regional terms: NEAPOLITAN (from Naples), PARMESAN (from Parma), BOLOGNESE (from Bologna), and VENETIAN (from Venice). This could be a category, but VENETIAN might also refer to blinds, creating ambiguity.
- Sports stadium features: JUMBOTRON (large screen), SCOREBOARD (score display), ASTROTURF (artificial turf), and SKYBOX (luxury seating). KISSCAM (a camera feature at events) could fit here, but it's not included in this initial group.
- Remaining words like CREAMSICLE (ice cream treat), RUSHMORE (Mount Rushmore monument), KISSCAM, and JOURNEYMAN (a worker level or band) don't form an obvious group yet.

Starting with the camera brand category is logical because it has clear connections and high confidence. If correct, these words will be removed, simplifying the puzzle for subsequent guesses. Confidence is high due to the unambiguous brand associations.

Confidence: 0.9 (high, based on the strength of the category).</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I analyzed these words and identified a clear category: adjectives derived from Italian city names, often associated with regional cuisine or origins. These include:
- **NEAPOLITAN**: Relates to Naples (commonly used for ice cream or pizza).
- **PARMESAN**: Relates to Parma (famously a cheese).
- **BOLOGNESE**: Relates to Bologna (a type of pasta sauce).
- **VENETIAN**: Relates to Venice (can refer to food, culture, or blinds, but in this grouping, it fits the regional theme).

This category is strong because all terms are linguistic derivatives of Italian cities. Other groups, like sports stadium features (e.g., JUMBOTRON, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX, ASTROTURF, KISSCAM), have five words and lack balance, so I'm excluding them for now. The outlier words (CREAMSICLE, RUSHMORE, JOURNEYMAN) don't form a coherent group yet, but if this guess is correct, they will be easier to analyze in subsequent steps.

Confidence is high because the Italian regional group is well-defined and consistent. If incorrect, I can reassess the sports or other categories.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I identified a potential category of portmanteaus—words formed by blending sounds and meanings of two words:
- **CREAMSICLE**: Blend of "cream" and "popsicle" (a frozen treat).
- **KISSCAM**: Blend of "kiss" and "camera" (a feature at events).
- **JUMBOTRON**: Blend of "jumbo" and "electron" (referring to large screens).
- **ASTROTURF**: Blend of "Astro" (from the Astrodome) and "turf" (artificial grass).

This group is distinct from the remaining words (RUSHMORE, SKYBOX, SCOREBOARD, JOURNEYMAN), which are compound words (formed by combining two words without blending sounds). The portmanteau group is plausible, though ASTROTURF is sometimes debated as a compound, making confidence moderate. If correct, the last group would logically be compound words.

Confidence: 0.7 (moderate, due to potential ambiguity with ASTROTURF).</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The previous grouping of portmanteaus (CREAMSICLE, KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, ASTROTURF) was incorrect, so I need to identify a different category. I noticed a strong cluster of words related to sports stadium features:  
- **JUMBOTRON**: A large video screen used in stadiums.  
- **SCOREBOARD**: Displays game scores and statistics.  
- **SKYBOX**: Premium enclosed seating area.  
- **KISSCAM**: An interactive camera feature during events.  

These all share a common theme of stadium technology or fan engagement tools. The exclusion of ASTROTURF (which is stadium-related but focuses on the playing surface) makes this group distinct.  

The remaining words (CREAMSICLE, RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, JOURNEYMAN) don't form an obvious group yet, but if this stadium feature guess is correct, they will be easier to analyze next.

Previous rejected categories:  
- Portmanteaus (CREAMSICLE, KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, ASTROTURF) was incorrect.  
- Stadium technology (JUMBOTRON, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX, KISSCAM) was incorrect.  

New analysis:  
- Notice that **RUSHMORE** (Mount Rushmore) and **ASTROTURF** (artificial turf) are both proper nouns commonly associated with American culture.  
- **CREAMSICLE** is a nostalgic American ice cream treat.  
- **JOURNEYMAN** is historically a craftsman title but also evokes American blue-collar work or the band "Journey."  
The connection is: **American cultural references**.  
- Rushmore: Iconic national monument.  
- Astroturf: Invented for Houston’s Astrodome, symbolizing American sports innovation.  
- Creamsicle: Classic American snack.  
- Journeyman: Reflects American labor history (e.g., trade unions).  

Meanwhile, other words:  
- **JUMBOTRON**, **SCOREBOARD**, **SKYBOX**, **KISSCAM** are event-specific terms and likely share a category.  
But if this guess is wrong, I’ll prioritize them next.

Previous incorrect guesses:  
- Portmanteaus (CREAMSICLE, KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, ASTROTURF) failed.  
- Stadium features (JUMBOTRON, SCOREBOARD, SKYBOX, KISSCAM) failed.  
- American cultural references (RUSHMORE, ASTROTURF, CREAMSICLE, JOURNEYMAN) failed.  

Now, I notice a pattern I overlooked: **compound words formed by combining two distinct words without blending sounds** (unlike portmanteaus, which blend sounds/meanings). These are:  
- **SKYBOX**: "sky" + "box" (luxury stadium seating).  
- **SCOREBOARD**: "score" + "board" (sports display).  
- **KISSCAM**: "kiss" + "cam" (short for "camera", an event feature).  
- **JOURNEYMAN**: "journey" + "man" (a skilled worker level).  

This contrasts with the remaining words:  
- JUMBOTRON (portmanteau: "jumbo" + "electron"), ASTROTURF (portmanteau: "Astro" + "turf"), CREAMSICLE (portmanteau: "cream" + "popsicle"), and RUSHMORE (proper noun, not compound).  

Confidence is moderate (0.7) because "KISSCAM" uses "cam" as shorthand, but it still fits the compound-word structure. If correct, the last group might be portmanteaus or proper nouns, but I'll address that after.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The available words are: BRIGHT, DUFFEL, BABY, PEE-WEE, BOUNCY, BUGGY, INDIANA, RUBBER, BUMPER, CARRY-ON, HEATHER, FERRIS, MERRY, SUNNY, ROLLER, HARD-SHELL.

Analyzing the words, I notice that "RUBBER," "BABY," "BUGGY," and "BUMPER" form a clear connection through the well-known tongue twister: "rubber baby buggy bumpers." This phrase is a common reference in wordplay, making it a likely category for a Connections puzzle. 

Other possible groupings were considered:
- Luggage-related: DUFFEL, CARRY-ON, HARD-SHELL, and possibly ROLLER (as in roller bag). But ROLLER could also fit amusement categories, so it's ambiguous for now.
- Amusement park rides: FERRIS (Ferris wheel), ROLLER (roller coaster), BUMPER (bumper cars), and perhaps INDIANA (Indiana Jones ride). However, BUMPER is part of the tongue twister group.
- Mood or descriptive terms: BRIGHT, SUNNY, MERRY, BOUNCY could all relate to cheerfulness or energy, but HEATHER and PEE-WEE don't fit well here.
- Baby-related: BABY, BUGGY (stroller), BOUNCY (bouncer), but BUGGY and BABY are covered in the tongue twister, and BOUNCY might not strongly align.

The tongue twister group stands out as strong and specific, with RUBBER, BABY, BUGGY, and BUMPER being directly tied. This is a better starting point, as it reduces ambiguity in subsequent guesses. If correct, I can address the remaining words next. Confidence is high due to the cultural recognition of the phrase.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I need to identify the next group. Analyzing the words:

- **Luggage/bag category**: DUFFEL (duffel bag), CARRY-ON (carry-on luggage), HARD-SHELL (hard-shell suitcase), and ROLLER (roller bag) form a clear connection. These all describe types of luggage or travel bags. ROLLER fits as shorthand for "roller bag" in common usage.

- **Amusement rides**: FERRIS (Ferris wheel), ROLLER (roller coaster), and INDIANA (Indiana Jones ride at Disney parks) could be a group, but ROLLER is also strong for luggage, and we lack a clear fourth word (e.g., BUMPER was already used). PEE-WEE might refer to a Pee-wee Herman ride, but it's weak.

- **Pop culture names**: PEE-WEE (Pee-wee Herman), INDIANA (Indiana Jones), FERRIS (Ferris Bueller), and HEATHER (possibly from the movie *Heathers*). This is plausible but less cohesive than luggage, as HEATHER is ambiguous (it could also be a fabric or name).

- **Descriptive words**: BRIGHT, SUNNY, MERRY, and BOUNCY could relate to cheerfulness or energy, but BOUNCY also connects to physical properties (e.g., bouncy castle), and SUNNY/MERRY are more atmospheric. This group feels forced compared to luggage.

The luggage category (DUFFEL, CARRY-ON, HARD-SHELL, ROLLER) is the strongest and most unambiguous. ROLLER is commonly used in "roller luggage," making it a natural fit. Confidence is high, as this group reduces ambiguity for the remaining words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I observe a clear pop culture theme: 
- **PEE-WEE** refers to Pee-wee Herman (character from *Pee-wee's Playhouse* and films).
- **INDIANA** refers to Indiana Jones (film series protagonist).
- **FERRIS** refers to Ferris Bueller (character from *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*).
- **HEATHER** refers to characters from the cult film *Heathers*.

This group is cohesive as iconic characters from movies/TV. The other words—BRIGHT, BOUNCY, MERRY, SUNNY—could form a related group for cheerful descriptors, supporting this separation.

First, I'll look for obvious categories. Words like RANK, GRADE, SCORE, and RATE stand out because they all relate to evaluation, measurement, or assessment. For example:
- RANK can refer to a position in a hierarchy.
- GRADE often means a score in academics or quality level.
- SCORE is commonly used in tests or games to denote points.
- RATE can indicate a speed, frequency, or an evaluation like a rating.

This seems like a coherent group for "evaluation metrics." While PACE could be loosely related to measurement (e.g., speed), it's less about evaluation and more about tempo, so I'm excluding it from this group.

Now, I'll consider other words to rule out alternative groupings:
- MASCARA and BLUSH are cosmetics, but DYE (e.g., hair dye) might fit as a beauty-related term, though it's not exclusively cosmetic. STOCKINGS or NOSE don't cleanly align here.
- TOWEL and SWEAT have an association (e.g., using a towel for sweat), but BLUSH or others don't fit a "hygiene" group.
- TIGER is an animal, but no other obvious animals are present.
- TRAIL and PACE might relate to movement or hiking, but I need two more words (e.g., CLIP could mean moving fast, but it's ambiguous).
- FIDGET, CLIP, and others seem less connected for now.

Given that, RANK, GRADE, SCORE, RATE appear to be the most consistent and common category. I'm confident in this, but not 100% since there might be other interpretations (e.g., RATE could be unrelated like currency rate, but contextually it fits evaluation).

I'll guess this group. If correct, I can address the remaining words in subsequent guesses.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I need to find the next group of four related words. After evaluating:

- MASCARA and BLUSH are clearly cosmetics (specific makeup products). DYE fits as a cosmetic when referring to hair dye, a personal grooming product. STOCKINGS is an apparel item that is often categorized under beauty or fashion accessories, as it enhances overall appearance and is sold in similar retail contexts (e.g., beauty sections in stores). Therefore, a potential group is "beauty/personal care items": DYE, MASCARA, BLUSH, STOCKINGS.

- Alternatives were considered but rejected: 
  - TIGER (animal) seems isolated without other animal words. 
  - TOWEL and SWEAT have a direct association (towel for wiping sweat), but no other words clearly fit a "hygiene" or "exercise" group.
  - TRAIL and PACE could relate to hiking or movement, but CLIP (as in moving quickly) is ambiguous, and SWEAT might be forced.
  - FIDGET and CLIP (as in fidgeting with a clip) lack a clear third and fourth word.
  - NOSE could tie to a body part but stands alone.

The most cohesive category remains the beauty group, despite some ambiguity with STOCKINGS. Confidence is moderate at 0.7 because STOCKINGS is less directly a "cosmetic" item but fits broadly into appearance enhancement.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I need to find a new group of four related words.

Analyzing the words:
- TOWEL and SWEAT have a strong connection: towels are often used to wipe sweat, especially during physical activities.
- TRAIL and PACE relate to movement or exercise: trails are paths for hiking/running, and pace refers to speed during such activities.
- This suggests a potential "exercise/physical activity" category: TOWEL (for wiping sweat), TRAIL (path for activity), PACE (speed of movement), SWEAT (result of exertion).
- Other words don't fit as well: 
  - DYE (cosmetic/coloring) is unrelated.
  - TIGER (animal) stands alone.
  - STOCKINGS (apparel) doesn't align.
  - FIDGET (restless movement) is too broad.
  - CLIP (fastener or cutting tool) lacks a clear connection.
  - NOSE (body part) is out of place.

This group feels cohesive for an "exercise" theme. Confidence is moderate (0.7) because CLIP could be loosely associated (e.g., bike clip for cycling), but it's weaker than this grouping.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- **PAPER TOWEL**: Common household item  
- **PAPER CLIP**: Office supply  
- **PAPER TRAIL**: Idiom for documenting evidence  
- **PAPER TIGER**: Idiom for something that appears threatening but is powerless  
This grouping relies on wordplay and idiomatic expressions, a frequent theme in NYT Connections. It avoids overlapping with previous categories and resolves the isolation of TIGER. Other words not in this group (e.g., BLUSH, FIDGET, PACE) don't fit this pattern.

Re-evaluating words for a new connection:
- **Nervous Behaviors Theme**: BLUSH (reddening from embarrassment), FIDGET (restless movement due to anxiety), SWEAT (perspiration from stress), and PACE (walking back and forth nervously) all describe physical manifestations of nervousness or anxiety. This forms a cohesive "signs of nervousness" category.
- **Exclusions**: 
  - DYE and MASCARA are beauty products, but were previously grouped and failed.

Other words like BROKE, BLEW, BURST, and SPLIT might form a "break/burst" category, while READ, CALL, FORECAST, and DIVINE could relate to prediction or divination. However, the supernatural group stands out as particularly clear and unambiguous based on common word meanings in this context.

Next, I observe a potential category centered around **breaking, bursting, or fragmenting**:  
- **BROKE**: Past tense of "break" (e.g., shattered or fractured).  
- **BLEW**: Past tense of "blow" (e.g., exploded or ruptured).

- **SPLIT**: Means to divide forcibly or break apart.  

This grouping is cohesive, as all terms relate to physical destruction or sudden separation. Other categories require more tenuous links:  
- Music genres (RAP, JAZZ, CHORAL, AMERICANA): AMERICANA isn't exclusively musical (it can mean cultural heritage), weakening the group.  
- Prediction (READ, DIVINE, FORECAST, CALL): CALL fits weakly (e.g., "calling an outcome"), while DIVINE/READ share occult connotations already partially covered.

The available words are: DOWNING, INSET, KEY, MAIN, BETTER, DOOR, BEST, FLEET, TOP, COMPASS, WALL, SCALE, GATE, HATCH, PORTAL, BEAT.

I noticed that several words relate to entrances or access points:
- DOOR is a common entryway to a building or room.
- GATE is an entrance, often in a fence or wall.
- HATCH is a small opening or doorway, like on a ship or floor.
- PORTAL can refer to a grand or fantastical entrance, such as in mythology or gaming.

These all share a clear category of "types of doorways or entrances." I considered other words like KEY, but KEY might be an accessory rather than an entrance itself, so it doesn't fit as well. This group seems cohesive with high confidence because the connection is straightforward and based on common definitions.

Other potential groupings (e.g., map elements such as INSET, KEY, COMPASS, SCALE) exist, but I'm focusing on this entrance group first due to its clarity. If correct, I can build on this for future guesses.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now analyzing for the next group:
- Many words align with mapping/navigation/geography:
  - KEY: Often refers to a map legend (e.g., explaining symbols).
  - COMPASS: A tool for direction/navigation.
  - SCALE: Represents proportions on a map.
  - INSET: A small map or diagram within a larger one.
- This forms a coherent "cartography/map elements" category.  
- Other words like WALL (a structure) or TOP/BEST (superlatives) don't fit well here.

Alternative groupings considered but rejected:
- SUPERLATIVES: TOP, BEST, BETTER, but no fourth word (e.g., "great" missing).
- NAVAL/MILITARY: FLEET (ships), DOWNING (shooting down), but not consistently matched (e.g., WALL and BEAT are weak fits).
- MAIN stands alone as an adjective (e.g., "primary"), with no clear group.

Confidence is high (0.8) due to thematic consistency, but slight uncertainty from word ambiguity (e.g., KEY could mean a tool rather than map legend, but context favors cartography).</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: DOWNING, MAIN, BETTER, BEST, FLEET, TOP, WALL, BEAT.

For the next group, I focused on the theme of surpassing or defeating:
- BEAT: Can mean to defeat or overcome.
- BETTER: Can mean to surpass or outdo (e.g., "better an opponent").
- BEST: Can mean to outdo or defeat (e.g., "best someone in a contest").
- DOWNING: Fits as a synonym for shooting down or defeating, especially in contexts like combat (e.g., "downing an enemy aircraft").

Alternative groupings were considered but rejected:
- FLEET, MAIN, TOP, WALL: Could suggest nautical themes (e.g., fleet as ships, main as in mainsail, top as in topmast, wall as a barrier) but lacks cohesion, and neither FLEET nor MAIN are strong matches for the remaining words in this context.
- WALL could fit in a group with used words like DOOR/GATE, but those are already categorized.
- TOP was considered for a "superlative" group with BEST/BETTER, but the need for a fourth word and the more precise "defeating" rationale for DOWNING made it less optimal here.

Confidence is high (0.7) due to thematic consistency, though "DOWNING" as a defeat term is slightly less common than BEAT/BETTER/BEST in everyday language, which adds minor uncertainty.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I identified two potential groupings:
1. **Famous streets:** DOWNING (as in Downing Street in London), FLEET (as in Fleet Street in London), WALL (as in Wall Street in New York), and MAIN (as in Main Street, a common street name).
2. **Verbs meaning "to surpass or exceed":** BEAT (to defeat or outdo), BEST (to surpass in competition), BETTER (to improve upon or exceed), and TOP (to exceed or outdo, e.g., "top a record").

The streets group has strong cultural recognition and fits neatly. The verbs group is similar to the previous incorrect guess but replaces DOWNING with TOP, which avoids the weaker connection (DOWNING as "shooting down" wasn't a perfect fit for "surpassing"). However, to avoid recycling a similar verb group, I'll prioritize the streets category first due to its coherence and distinct theme. If correct, the remaining words will naturally form the verb group.

Confidence is 0.7 since "MAIN" as Main Street is common but slightly more generic than the others.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Only four words remain: BETTER, BEST, TOP, BEAT.

Analyzing connections:
- BETTER, BEST, and TOP all relate to superiority or high achievement:
  - BEST is the superlative form of "good" (e.g., highest rank)
  - BETTER is comparative for "superior in quality"
  - TOP implies peak position (e.g., top performer)
- BEAT completes this as a verb meaning "to defeat" or "surpass" (e.g., "beat the competition").
- Together they form a cohesive category: **words meaning to outdo or achieve superiority**.

Alternative interpretations rejected:
- Adjectival groups alone lack consistency (BETTER/BEST/TOP are also adjectives, but BEAT is a verb/noun).
- "Beat" could imply rhythm, but no related words remain (e.g., drum, tempo).
- Since only 4 words are left, they must form the final category.

Confidence is 0.95 due to unambiguous thematic alignment – all terms fit "competitive superiority."</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now, I need to identify another group of four related words. Among the remaining words, several are associated with religious figures or titles:
- POPE: The head of the Roman Catholic Church.
- BISHOP: A senior clergy member in Christian churches.
- SAINT PATRICK: A specific saint, the patron saint of Ireland.
- SAINT VALENTINE: A specific saint associated with Valentine's Day.

These four share a clear connection as prominent figures in Christian tradition. POPE and BISHOP are formal titles, while SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE are venerated saints. This group excludes CLERGY MEMBER (a broader term) and MOTHER (which could be religious but is ambiguous), but the connection among these four is strong and specific.

Other potential groupings were considered but rejected:
- Sports (N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER) has only two entries, and adding BIRD or BURNS (e.g., as athlete references) is speculative.
- Leadership roles (PRESIDENT, POPE, BISHOP) lacks a fourth member and overlaps with religion.
- Saints alone (SAINT VALENTINE, SAINT PATRICK) has only two words.

This leaves SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE ungrouped, but they are specific saints rather than general titles. Other groupings like sports (N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B.

Re-evaluating the words, I see a potential category for common surnames:
- POPE (e.g., Alexander Pope, poet)
- BISHOP (e.g., Elizabeth Bishop, poet)
- BURNS (e.g., George Burns, actor/comedian)
- LORDE (stage name of singer Ella Yelich-O'Connor, often treated as a surname in pop culture)

This group is distinct from the remaining words (BIRD, CLERGY MEMBER, N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER), which may form a separate "professions" or "roles" category if needed. The surname connection is plausible, though LORDE as a surname is less conventional, reducing confidence slightly. Given only one incorrect guess remains, this is the strongest untested category after ruling out religious groups (previously failed) and sports groups (inconsistent).

Alternative groupings (e.g., BIRD and BURNS as athletes) have already failed, reinforcing the surname approach.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

  - BIRD could imply a sports figure (e.g., Larry Bird, NBA legend) when used in context.
  - CLERGY MEMBER denotes a religious role.

  Not perfectly cohesive, as BIRD alone lacks an inherent "role" meaning without context.

The available words are: TSK, KONG, FOLEY, TUT, COBRA, RACE, SHAME, ZIP, FLY, AKEEM, CAKE, BAD, TUT TUT, DOLITTLE, BARREL, DONKEY.

First, I should consider obvious categories. Words like FLY, ZIP, RACE, and BARREL stand out:
- FLY can mean to move quickly through the air.
- ZIP can mean to move rapidly.
- RACE can mean a speed competition.
- BARREL, as a verb, means to move at high speed, e.g., "barreling down the road."

This suggests a theme of words associated with speed or rapid movement.

Other potential groups exist, such as:
- Disapproval sounds: TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, and SHAME (though SHAME is more conceptual than a sound, it can relate to reproof).
- Film/character references: KONG (King Kong), COBRA (Cobra film or character), DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle), AKEEM (Prince Akeem from Coming to America).
- Animals/creatures: KONG (ape), COBRA (snake), DONKEY (animal), FLY (insect), but this might be too broad.

After evaluating, the speed/movement group seems the most cohesive and direct. BARREL as a verb for speed is a common informal usage. This group has consistent word types (all can be verbs implying motion) and doesn't rely on pop culture, which might be more ambiguous (e.g., COBRA could refer to multiple things).

My confidence isn't perfect because BARREL has other meanings (e.g., a container), but the thematic link to movement is reasonable. I'll start with this group to test, saving other groups for later if needed.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now, I need to identify another group of four related words. I notice several words that are expressions or sounds of disapproval:
- TSK: A clicking sound used to express disapproval or pity.
- TUT: An exclamation of annoyance or mild disapproval.
- TUT TUT: A variant of "tut," often written with a space, expressing the same sentiment.
- SHAME: An interjection used to express disapproval or disappointment (e.g., "Shame on you!").

This group forms a cohesive theme of "disapproval sounds/interjections." TSK, TUT, and TUT TUT are onomatopoeic, while SHAME is a common word in reproachful contexts. The connection is strong because all are used to convey criticism or disappointment.

Other potential groups exist but seem less consistent:
- Movie characters: KONG (King Kong), COBRA (Cobra film/character), DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle), AKEEM (Prince Akeem from Coming to America). However, DONKEY (from Shrek) is also present but unused here, and FOLEY (film sound effects) doesn't fit cleanly.
- Food/objects: CAKE, BARREL (already guessed), ZIP (guessed), but no clear group remains.
- Negative concepts: BAD, SHAME, but SHAME fits better in the disapproval group, and BAD is too vague without partners.

Thus, the disapproval group is the most compelling next guess. Confidence is high due to the thematic consistency, though SHAME is slightly more conceptual than the others.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The available words now are: TSK, KONG, FOLEY, TUT, COBRA, SHAME, AKEEM, CAKE, BAD, TUT TUT, DOLITTLE, DONKEY.

The disapproval sounds theme didn't work, so I'm pivoting to other connections. I notice that FOLEY is a key term in film sound production, and TSK, TUT, TUT TUT are actual sounds often created or represented in media (like by Foley artists). This forms a cohesive "sound effects or onomatopoeic expressions used in film/audio" category. FOLEY ties it together as the broader concept, while the others are specific examples.

Meanwhile, other groupings are less compelling:
- Movie characters (e.g., KONG, AKEEM, COBRA, DOLITTLE, DONKEY) has too many candidates and no clear four-word subset. For example, AKEEM (Coming to America), DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle), and DONKEY (Shrek) are Eddie Murphy roles, but KONG (King Kong) isn't, and FOLEY doesn't fit. 
- SHAME and BAD are abstract concepts without clear partners. 
- CAKE seems isolated without food-related words. 

Thus, the sound effects group (TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, FOLEY) is the strongest bet, though I'm cautious due to the previous rejection of a similar group. Confidence isn't higher because SHAME was a close fit in the last incorrect guess, and replacing it with FOLEY might not be ideal—but FOLEY's specificity to sound production makes it a logical pivot.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The previous disapproval/sound effects themes failed, so I'm shifting focus to film/character connections. Specifically, I notice several words tied to animal-themed characters or creatures from popular media:
- **KONG**: Refers to King Kong, the giant ape from films.
- **COBRA**: Represents the snake, often associated with characters like G.I. Joe's Cobra Commander or the film "Cobra".
- **DONKEY**: The talking donkey character from the "Shrek" films.
- **DOLITTLE**: Dr. Dolittle, a character who communicates with animals, from books and movies.

This group forms a cohesive "animal-related characters" category. All are iconic figures where animals play a central role, even if DOLITTLE is human but defined by animal interactions. 

Other groupings seem weaker:
- **AKEEM** (Prince Akeem from "Coming to America") is a human character without animal ties, so it doesn't fit here.
- **FOLEY** (film sound effects) is unrelated to characters.
- **TSK, TUT, TUT TUT** were previously guessed incorrectly and don't align.
- **SHAME, BAD, CAKE** lack clear connections to this theme or each other.

While not perfect (DOLITTLE isn't an animal, but is animal-adjacent), this is the most logical group given the words. Confidence is moderate due to the thematic consistency across films.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The key insight is that AKEEM, DOLITTLE, DONKEY, and FOLEY all refer to iconic film characters portrayed by Eddie Murphy:
- **AKEEM**: Prince Akeem from *Coming to America*.
- **DOLITTLE**: Dr. John Dolittle from *Dr. Dolittle*.
- **DONKEY**: The talking donkey from *Shrek* (voiced by Murphy).
- **FOLEY**: Axel Foley from *Beverly Hills Cop*.

This forms a tight, specific category of "Eddie Murphy roles," distinct from earlier animal-themed groupings that failed (e.g., KONG and COBRA). The connection is strong because all are major characters defined by Murphy's performances. 

For the remaining words:
- TSK, TUT, TUT TUT are disapproval sounds but don't fit neatly with others after prior failed attempts.
- SHAME, BAD, CAKE lack clear links (e.g., SHAME and BAD are abstract, CAKE is standalone).
- KONG and COBRA could fit a creature/villain category but don't pair well.
This guess isolates the clearest remaining group with high confidence due to its pop-culture coherence and avoids recycled themes.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- **KONG**: Represents King Kong, a destructive/terrifying force in pop culture.
- **COBRA**: Symbolizes a dangerous snake or villainous organization (e.g., G.I. Joe's Cobra).
- **SHAME**: A strong negative emotion or social rebuke.
- **BAD**: A fundamental negative descriptor (e.g., "bad" as in evil or harmful).

This group avoids reused themes and isolates words with inherently negative connotations. The remaining words (TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, CAKE) could form a secondary group for the next guess—likely disapproval sounds with CAKE not fitting, which supports prioritizing the negative-concept guess.

The available words are: BANK, CARPET, STRAND, FIREWORKS, CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, PIP, WOOD, COAST, SPARK, LAMINATE, BANSHEE, WAILER, HEARTBREAKER, TILE, SHORE.

First, I look for obvious groups. Words like CARPET, TILE, LAMINATE, and WOOD stand out as types of flooring materials or coverings. CARPET is a common soft flooring, TILE is often used for floors (e.g., ceramic tile), LAMINATE refers to laminate flooring, and WOOD typically refers to hardwood flooring. This seems like a solid, unambiguous category with strong real-world associations.

Other potential groups exist:
- Geographical features near water: BANK (river bank), COAST, SHORE, STRAND (beach).

a romantic/personal dynamic theme: CHEMISTRY (romantic attraction), CONNECTION (relationship bond), SPARK (ignition of interest), HEARTBREAKER (one who causes emotional pain).

The flooring group (CARPET, TILE, LAMINATE, WOOD) is the most straightforward and least ambiguous, making it a good starting guess.

Looking for connections:
- BANK, COAST, SHORE, and STRAND all share a strong geographical theme: They refer to landforms adjacent to bodies of water. BANK often means river bank, COAST is the ocean shoreline, SHORE is a general term for land along water, and STRAND is another word for beach or shore. This group is cohesive and unambiguous.
  
- Other possibilities exist but are less likely: 
  - BANSHEE and WAILER share a "noise-making entity" theme (both involve wailing), but HEARTBREAKER doesn't fit cleanly here, and no obvious fourth word (PIP could mean a sound but is weak). 
  - FIREWORKS, SPARK, and CHEMISTRY might loosely connect (e.g., via reactions or light), but CONNECTION doesn't align well.

First, a strong group related to relationships/romance:
- CHEMISTRY: Refers to romantic or interpersonal attraction.
- CONNECTION: Describes an emotional bond or relationship.
- SPARK: Represents the initial attraction or ignition of interest.
- HEARTBREAKER: Someone who causes emotional pain by ending a relationship.

This grouping is coherent and commonly used in contextual language. The connection is unambiguous, with all terms frequently appearing together in dating/relationship discussions.

The remaining words (FIREWORKS, PIP, BANSHEE, WAILER) appear to form a "sound/noise" theme:
- FIREWORKS: Create explosive sounds (bangs, whistles).
- PIP: Refers to a short, high-pitched sound (e.g., time signal beep).
- BANSHEE: A mythical spirit known for its piercing wail.
- WAILER: Something or someone that produces a prolonged, mournful cry.

Upon re-examining, I identified a "sources of sound/noise" theme:
- **FIREWORKS**: Create loud explosive sounds (bangs, whistles).
- **PIP**: Refers to a short, high-pitched sound (e.g., a beep in timing signals or electronics).
- **BANSHEE**: A mythical spirit known for its piercing wail or shriek.
- **WAILER**: Something or someone that produces a prolonged, loud cry (literally or figuratively).

This grouping is cohesive and distinct from the failed romance/relationship theme. The words all directly relate to sound production, and the connection is consistent with real-world associations and common word usage.

Other groupings were considered but discarded:
 ile lines of a "science/energy" theme (e.g., CHEMISTRY, SPARK, CONNECTION) as CHEMISTRY lacks a clear sound link, and FIREWORKS was too broad. HEARTBREAKER was also considered for emotional distress themes but didn't cleanly fit with the sound categories.
-. The sound group stands out as the most reliable.

I now suspect that BANSHEE, WAILER, HEARTBREAKER, and PIP could form a less obvious category: "words used as nicknames or proper names in popular culture."  
- **BANSHEE**: Refers to a nickname for vehicles (e.g., Dodge Challenger SRT Banshee) or bands (e.g., Siouxsie and the Banshees).  
- **WAILER**: Associated with bands (e.g., The Wailers, Bob Marley’s group).  
- **HEARTBREAKER**: Commonly a nickname for people (e.g., Casanovas) or song titles (e.g., Pat Benatar's "Heartbreaker").  
- **PIP**: Used as a diminutive name (e.g., Philip "Pip" from Dickens' Great Expectations) or in pop culture (e.g., the Pokémon character).  

This grouping connects through cultural references and naming conventions, which is a plausible NYT Connections category. While it’s not perfect (e.g., PIP is less commonly used than others), it addresses the lack of cohesion in previous guesses. Other groupings were considered:  
- CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, SPARK, FIREWORKS might relate to "reactions" (e.g., chemical, emotional, or explosive), but FIREWORKS and SPARK clash with the abstractness of CHEMISTRY and CONNECTION.  
- PIP, SPARK, and FIREWORKS don't share a consistent secondary theme with the others.  

Given the remaining words, this name/nickname category seems the most viable, but confidence is moderate due to its reliance on contextual usage.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

These words form a clear thematic category: **metaphors for intense relationships or emotional experiences**.

- **CHEMISTRY**: Directly references the intangible attraction or "spark" between people.  
- **CONNECTION**: Denotes emotional or relational bonds.  
- **SPARK**: Represents the ignition of attraction or energy in a relationship.  

This thematic grouping is consistent with NYT Connections' wordplay, where everyday terms are repurposed for abstract human experiences.

The words are: MIME, REFEREE, SAILOR, DROP, PRINCESS, FREEZE, GENIE, APOLLO, SAMURAI, PARROT, FANTASTIC, LAG, PRISONER, MONKEY, ECHO, CANDLES.

First, I'll consider potential categories by grouping similar words:

- **Professions/Roles**: REFEREE, SAILOR, PRINCESS, SAMURAI, PRISONER. But PRINCESS is more of a title than an occupation, and not all fit neatly (e.g., SAMURAI is historical, REFEREE is sports-specific).
- **Actions/Verbs**: DROP, FREEZE, LAG, ECHO, PARROT, MONKEY. Many can be verbs (e.g., "drop something," "freeze in place," "lag behind," "echo a sound," "parrot speech," "monkey around"). However, some verbs have different connotations, so I need a tighter theme.
- **Character/Types**: PRINCESS, GENIE, SAMURAI, MONKEY (as in the Monkey King), APOLLO (as a god), but APOLLO is a proper noun, and MONKEY could be literal, making it inconsistent.
- **Game Associations**: MIME (charades), FREEZE (freeze tag), DROP (e.g., drop the handkerchief game), MONKEY (monkey in the middle game). This seems cohesive as all relate to children's games or playground activities.
- **Sound/Repetition**: ECHO, PARROT (parroting words), but MIME is silent, and others like LAG (delay) don't fit well.

The game association group (MIME, FREEZE, DROP, MONKEY) stands out:
- MIME: Often involves miming actions in games like charades.
- FREEZE: Refers to the game "freeze tag" where players must freeze when tagged.
- DROP: Associated with games like "drop the handkerchief" or "hot potato" where dropping is part of the action.
- MONKEY: Directly references "monkey in the middle," a game where players try to keep an object away from a central player.

This group feels logical and thematically consistent. Other groups can be explored if this is incorrect, but I'll start here.

Confidence is 0.7 because while the connection is strong, there might be other interpretations (e.g., MONKEY could be seen as less directly game-related, but it's a common game name). If wrong, I'll adapt based on feedback.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

My previous incorrect guess (MIME, FREEZE, DROP, MONKEY) focused on games, but I must pivot. 

First, I notice several words that can function as verbs:
- **FREEZE** (to halt movement)
- **LAG** (to fall behind)
- **ECHO** (to repeat a sound)
- **PARROT** (to mimic speech)

These share a common linguistic property: all can be used transitively or intransitively as action verbs. For example:
- "The computer will *freeze* if overloaded."
- "He started to *lag* in the race."
- "Her voice *echoed* in the hall."
- "The child *parroted* the teacher's words."

Other verbs like "drop" or "mime" were rejected, but these remain available. While other words (e.g., REFEREE) can be verbs, they're less core action words. This group feels cohesive for "verbs meaning to replicate, delay, or stop action."

Alternative groups were considered but dismissed:
- **Roles/Jobs (REFEREE, SAILOR, SAMURAI, PRISONER)**: Too broad (REFEREE is sports, SAILOR maritime, SAMURAI historical, PRISONER legal), and PRINCESS doesn't fit cleanly.  
- **Mythology/Fantasy (APOLLO, GENIE, ECHO, PRINCESS)**: Inconsistent (ECHO is Greek myth, GENIE Arabian, APOLLO Greek, PRINCESS fairy-tale).  
- **Compound phrases (e.g., ECHO chamber, PARROT fashion)**: Possible but less consistent than the verb connection since FANTASTIC, PRINCESS don't fit this.

Confidence is 0.7: The verb connection is strong, though not exclusive (e.g., PARROT is also a noun). If incorrect, I'll explore thematic groups like mythology or roles next.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I notice that DROP, LAG, ECHO, and FREEZE share a common theme in computing/technology:
- **DROP**: Often used in tech contexts, like "drop table" in SQL or "packet drop" in networking.
- **LAG**: Refers to delays in network or system performance (e.g., "network lag").
- **ECHO**: A command in programming and scripting (e.g., `echo` in Linux to output text).
- **FREEZE**: Describes a system or application becoming unresponsive (e.g., "computer freeze").

This connection centers on "verbs describing common computer issues or actions." While some words have broader meanings, their tech-specific uses create a cohesive group.

Other groupings considered:
- **Mythology/fantasy (GENIE, APOLLO, ECHO, PRINCESS)**: Inconsistent origins (ECHO is Greek, GENIE is Arabian, APOLLO is Greek, PRINCESS is generic fairy tale).
- **Roles/titles (REFEREE, SAILOR, SAMURAI, PRISONER)**: Too broad (e.g., PRISONER is a status, not a job).
- **Imitation (MIME, PARROT, ECHO, MONKEY)**: PARROT and MONKEY imply mimicry, but ECHO is about sound repetition, and MIME is silent acting. The group lacks precision.

Confidence is 0.8: The computing link is strong, though not all words are exclusively tech-related (e.g., ECHO also refers to sound in general). If incorrect, I'll explore mythological or role-based groups next.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I am now looking for the next group of four. After analyzing, I notice that GENIE, PRINCESS, PARROT, and CANDLES can be linked as **Disney characters or elements from Disney stories**:
- GENIE: From *Aladdin*, a major character.
- PRINCESS: Represents Disney Princesses, a well-known franchise (e.g., Cinderella, Snow White).
- PARROT: Refers to Iago, the parrot from *Aladdin*.
- CANDLES: Likely alluding to Lumière, the candlestick from *Beauty and the Beast*.

This connection is thematic and fits within pop culture categories common in Connections puzzles. Other words like MONKEY (e.g., King Louie from *The Jungle Book*) were considered, but PARROT is a stronger fit with *Aladdin*, and CANDLES directly points to Lumière. The group is cohesive without relying on loose interpretations. If incorrect, I will explore other themes in future guesses, such as historical roles (e.g., SAMURAI, SAILOR) or mimicry (MIME, PARROT).

Confidence is 0.7 due to PRINCESS being broad (it could fit fairy tales generally), but the Disney-specific references make it reasonable.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Though PRINCESS, GENIE, PARROT, and CANDLES were in the last guess, they were not correct, so they remain available.  

I need to find a group of four related words. Since thematic categories didn't work in previous guesses, I re-examined the words and identified a potential group: **"Combat or Figurative Struggle" roles**.  

- **REFEREE**: An official who mediates conflict in sports (e.g., boxing or wrestling).  
- **PRISONER**: Someone confined, often in a context involving capture or war.  
- **SAILOR**: A naval role associated with military or combat scenarios (e.g., sailors in armed forces).  
- **SAMURAI**: A historical warrior class known for combat.  

This group focuses on roles linked to structured conflict or adversarial systems. Other groupings were considered but rejected:  
- **Mythology/Fantasy (APOLLO, GENIE, PRINCESS)**: Inconsistent origins (e.g., APOLLO is Greek, GENIE is Arabic) and no clear fourth member (FANTASTIC is an adjective).  
- **Imitation/Mimicry (MIME, PARROT, MONKEY)**: Too vague without a strong fourth member (e.g., APOLLO doesn't fit).  
- **Disney/Fairy Tales (repeated)**: Already attempted and incorrect in the last guess.  

Confidence is 0.6, as the combat/struggle connection is logical but not airtight (e.g., SAILOR can be civilian). If incorrect, the final guess will explore imitation themes.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I identified a strong potential category: ice cream treats. CONE can refer to an ice cream cone, CUP can indicate ice cream served in a cup, SHAKE is commonly used for a milkshake (often made with ice cream), and SPLIT refers to a banana split, which is an ice cream-based dessert. This connection is consistent and thematically solid. 

Other groupings are possible (e.g., LIBERAL, PROGRESSIVE, LEFT, BLUE for political terms; RAINMAKER, DEPARTED, GOOD SHEPHERD, MARTIAN for movies with "The" in their titles), but I am starting with this one due to its clear and unambiguous theme.

I am considering potential categories among the remaining words. I notice a strong cluster related to movies with the word "The" in their titles:
- RAINMAKER: Refers to "The Rainmaker" (1997 film).
- DEPARTED: Refers to "The Departed" (2006 film).
- GOOD SHEPHERD: Refers to "The Good Shepherd" (2006 film).
- MARTIAN: Refers to "The Martian" (2015 film).

This connection is consistent, as all are well-known movies commonly referenced with "The" in the title. Other groupings exist but are less cohesive: e.g., political terms (LIBERAL, PROGRESSIVE, LEFT, BLUE) or mythology (GREEK/ROMAN GOD, GOOD SHEPHERD), but the movie category stands out as it has four clear matches without overlap. Confidence is high because this is a recurring theme in Connections puzzles.

Alternative groupings, such as space-related (MARTIAN, SPACECRAFT) or theater terms (THEATER), lack four strong members. Thus, this seems the most reliable next guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I need to identify a group of four related words. Among these, LIBERAL, PROGRESSIVE, LEFT, and BLUE form a coherent category related to U.S. political ideology. Specifically:
- LIBERAL: Refers to a political philosophy emphasizing social progress and equality.
- PROGRESSIVE: A synonym for liberal, often used interchangeably in modern politics.
- LEFT: Describes the left-wing side of the political spectrum, associated with liberalism.
- BLUE: Commonly signifies the Democratic Party in U.S. politics (e.g., "blue states"), which is aligned with liberal/progressive views.

This grouping is well-established in common parlance, especially within the context of American political discourse. While BLUE has other meanings (e.g., a color), in this list, it logically fits the political theme given the presence of LIBERAL, PROGRESSIVE, and LEFT.

The other words (THEATER, GREEK/ROMAN GOD, FICTIONAL BOXER, SPACECRAFT) do not easily fit a single category with these, but I expect them to form the last group later. For now, with no obvious conflicts, this political group seems the most reliable guess.

Confidence is high as all terms directly align, but I acknowledge BLUE might be ambiguous in isolation; however, the context supports this interpretation. Thus, I am proceeding with this guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

After analyzing, I identified a strong connection: all terms relate to the Greek/Roman god Apollo in different contexts:
- **GREEK/ROMAN GOD**: Apollo is a prominent deity in Greek and Roman mythology.
- **FICTIONAL BOXER**: Refers to Apollo Creed, the character from the Rocky film series, named after the god.
- **SPACECRAFT**: Refers to NASA's Apollo program (e.g., Apollo 11), named after the god.

The words that stand out as potentially belonging to the same category are SWEARING, EXPLETIVES, PROFANITY, and FOUR-LETTER WORDS. Here's the reasoning:

- SWEARING is the act of using offensive language.
- EXPLETIVES refers to swear words or interjections, often used in anger or emphasis.
- PROFANITY is the concept of blasphemous or vulgar language.
- FOUR-LETTER WORDS is a common euphemism for short, taboo swear words (like "damn" or "fuck").

These words are all closely related to the theme of offensive or taboo language. This category seems strong conceptually, as it's a common grouping in word association games like Connections. While other possible connections exist (e.g., words ending in "ring" like EARRING or HERRING, or clothing items like MESH SHIRT), they are not as cohesive or complete as this group. With no prior guesses, this appears to be the most logical and reliable first guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The remaining words are: HERRING, EARRING, MYSTERY, NECKLACE, CHRISTMAS, MESH SHIRT, OUROBOROS, STIRRING, HOUSE, HISTAMINE, PLEATHER VEST, MOUSE.

Now, I need to find the next group of four related words. Analyzing the list:

- **EARRING** and **NECKLACE** are both types of jewelry/accessories worn on the body.
- **MESH SHIRT** and **PLEATHER VEST** are both clothing items (tops) that are worn.
- Together, these four words—EARRING, NECKLACE, MESH SHIRT, PLEATHER VEST—form a coherent category: "things you wear" or "wearable items." This is a common Connections theme, and the group fits well despite EARRING/NECKLACE being jewelry and MESH SHIRT/PLEATHER VEST being clothing, as they share the core concept of being worn.

Other potential groupings were considered but rejected:
- Words ending in "ring" (HERRING, EARRING, STIRRING) only have three words and lack a fourth.
- "Red herring" connections (HERRING and MYSTERY) are incomplete without additional words like "red."
- Clothing items (MESH SHIRT, PLEATHER VEST) only have two without EARRING/NECKLACE, which aren't typically classified as clothing.
- No other strong categories emerged for the remaining words (e.g., OUROBOROS is standalone, CHRISTMAS is thematic, HOUSE/MOUSE rhyme but lack two more).

Thus, this guess is the most logical and cohesive. Confidence is high due to the clear wearable theme.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I need to identify the next group of four. After analysis, potential connections include:
- **Attractions/Entertainment Theme**: MYSTERY and CHRISTMAS relate to themed attractions (e.g., "mystery spots" or "Christmas villages"). HOUSE works as "haunted house," often a standalone attraction. MOUSE connects to Disney or other mouse-themed parks/attractions.
- **Cohesiveness**: This group ("attractions or entertainment experiences") is distinct. Other combinations lack strength:
  - HERRING/STIRRING share "ring" suffix but need two more (only EARRING did, but it's used). 
  - HISTAMINE has no link to animals (with MOUSE/HERRING) or cycles (with OUROBOROS).
  - OUROBOROS/STIRRING/CHRISTMAS imply "cycles" but MOUSE doesn't fit.
- **Confidence Drivers**: HOUSE and MOUSE are frequently paired culturally (e.g., in rhymes or idioms), while MYSTERY and CHRISTMAS broaden to experiential themes. This grouping minimizes overlap and fits Connections' penchant for thematic categories.

Thus, MYSTERY, CHRISTMAS, HOUSE, MOUSE form the most plausible category. Confidence is moderate due to creative interpretation of the theme.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

After extensive analysis, I identify the theme: **all can be associated with the concept of "mystery" or misinformation in varying contexts.**

- **HERRING**: Specifically the phrase "red herring," referring to a misleading clue commonly used in mystery narratives to distract from the truth.
- **MYSTERY**: Directly represents the genre itself, where puzzles, enigmas, and red herrings are central.
- **OUROBOROS**: As an ancient symbol often depicted as a serpent eating its own tail, it appears in mystery, occult, or conspiracy-themed contexts (e.g., secret societies or esoteric puzzles).
- **HISTAMINE**: Fits through its association with "mystery ailments," such as unexplained allergies (e.g., "mystery allergy" triggers histamine release). While a weaker connection, it aligns thematically with the vagueness of immune responses.

Alternative groupings were tested but failed:
- Bio-chemical: Only histamine fits easily (ouroboros and herring lack relevant ties).
- Animal-based: Herring (fish) and ouroboros (serpent) are animals, but mystery and histamine do not fit.
- Sound-alikes: No consistent homophones (e.g., herring/"hearing" not echoed).

Though this connection is imperfect (e.g., histamine requires conceptual stretching), the unavoidable puzzle logic and common Connections conventions support a "mystery-adjacent" category. Confidence is limited by histamine's niche fit.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, I'll look for obvious categories. One group that stands out consists of words that can be verbs meaning evasive or quick downward movements:
- DODGE: To avoid something by moving quickly aside.
- DUCK: To lower the head or body to avoid something.
- DIVE: To plunge or jump down quickly, often to evade.
- DIP: To drop or lower briefly, e.g., in sports or to avoid detection.

This group has a clear connection, as all relate to physical movements used to dodge or escape something. It's a common category in puzzles like this, and here, the meanings are consistent. However, I must consider if other groupings are possible. For instance, DODGE, DUCK, and DIVE are solid, but DIP can mean many things (e.g., sauce or a food-related term). Yet in this context, the evasive action connection is plausible.

Other potential groups:
- Car brands: LINCOLN, FORD, DODGE, RAM. LINCOLN, FORD, and DODGE are clear, and RAM can refer to the Dodge Ram truck brand. But DODGE is used in both this and the evasive group, so I have to choose one category per word. If I pick this car group, it leaves DIP, DUCK, DIVE without a clear fourth for evasion.
- Food items: WING (as in chicken wing), CHIP (potato chip), DIP (dip sauce), FRY (french fry). But this uses DIP, conflicting with the evasion group. Also, FRY might refer to fried food, but it's ambiguous.

After reviewing, the evasive action group seems strong and doesn't rely on less common interpretations (like RAM as a car brand being slightly debatable). The words DODGE, DUCK, DIVE, DIP are all action verbs that fit well together. Confidence is reduced slightly due to DIP's multiple meanings, but in standard Connections fashion, this should be acceptable.

For other words:
- SENATOR, STAR, FLYER, etc., will be addressed in subsequent guesses if correct.

Thus, I'll start with this evasion group.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The incorrect feedback confirms that the evasion action group is not valid, so I must look for other connections.

One prominent possibility is automotive brands, which includes:
- LINCOLN: A luxury car brand under Ford.
- FORD: A major American car manufacturer.
- DODGE: A well-known car brand.
- RAM: Specifically refers to Ram Trucks, which is closely associated with Dodge (historically part of the Dodge brand).

This group is highly coherent and a common category in Connections puzzles. The words are directly linked as brand names in the automotive industry. Other words like ROCKET or SCRAPER don't fit here, reinforcing the strength of this grouping.

I considered alternative categories:
- Snack foods: CHIP, DIP, FRY, WING could work (chips and dip, french fries, chicken wings), but since DIP was in the previous incorrect group, it might still be usable here if the category changes. However, I'm prioritising the car brands as it seems stronger and more defined.
- Birds: DUCK and LARK are birds, but DIVE doesn't fit as a bird, and there's no clear fourth word (e.g., STAR is celestial).
- Flight-related: ROCKET, FLYER, WING might connect to aviation or space, but STAR (when not interpreted as a celebrity) lacks a direct flight association, and LARK as a bird that flies is ambiguous.

Given the clarity and commonality of the car brands category, and without knowing why the first group was wrong, I'll proceed with this guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now, I need to find the next group of four related words. One strong category is snack or fast food items:
- CHIP: Refers to potato chips, a common snack.
- DIP: Often paired with chips as a dipping sauce.
- FRY: Short for french fries, a popular fast food item.
- WING: Refers to chicken wings, a bar snack or fast food staple.

This grouping is cohesive and frequently appears in Connections puzzles. Alternative interpretations exist (e.g., WING as part of a bird or FRY as a verb), but the food context dominates here. Other words like DUCK (which could be food but is less commonly categorized with these) or SCRAPER (a tool) don't fit well, reinforcing this category.

Other potential groups were considered but rejected:
- Birds: DUCK, LARK, DIVE (as in diving birds), and WING could work, but DIVE and WING are ambiguous, and FRY doesn't fit. This is less compelling than the food group.
- Movement verbs: DIP, DUCK, DIVE, and FRY (as in "jump") might seem possible, but FRY doesn't align well, and our first guess with similar words (DODGE, DUCK, DIVE, DIP) was already incorrect.
- Space/flight: STAR, ROCKET, FLYER, WING could relate to aviation, but STAR is primarily celestial, and FLYER often means a pamphlet, making this inconsistent.

Given the clarity of the food category, I'll proceed with this guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I need to find a valid group among the remaining words. After analysis, a strong connection emerges: DIVE, ROCKET, LARK, and SCRAPER can form compounds with "sky":
- "skydive" (for DIVE)
- "skyrocket" (for ROCKET)
- "skylark" (for LARK)
- "skyscraper" (for SCRAPER)

This is a recognized category in word puzzles like Connections. SCRAPER explicitly invokes skyscraper (as the suffix), making it consistent.

The remaining words (SENATOR, STAR, FLYER, DUCK) don't obviously align with this, but they can form the next group if this guess is correct. Alternative interpretations were considered:
- Birds (DUCK, LARK) — incomplete and clashes with LARK in the sky group.
- Movement verbs (DIVE, DUCK) — lacks a clear fourth word.
- Aviation/titles (e.g., FLYER, SENATOR) — inconsistent with SCRAPER/ROCKET.

- **SENATOR**: Refers to an elected official in government.
- **STAR**: Can signify a "rising star" or political star, meaning a prominent and influential figure in politics.
- **FLYER**: Often denotes a promotional handout, such as a campaign flyer used in political elections.
- **DUCK**: Refers to a "lame duck," a term for an elected official who is nearing the end of their term and has reduced influence, commonly used in politics.

The common thread among all these words is their association with politics, governance, or election campaigns. Specifically:
- **SENATOR**: The office itself.
- **STAR**: Symbolizes a high-performing or celebrated politician.
- **FLYER**: A tool for political campaigning.
- **DUCK**: Describes a phase in a politician's tenure.

This grouping is logical and cohesive, as all terms tie back to the political sphere, which is a recognized category in word puzzles. While DUCK also has other meanings (e.g., a bird), in this context, "lame duck" is a well-known political idiom. Confidence is moderate because STAR might be stretched in meaning, but the connection is consistent with Connections-style categories.

The words are: ZOOM, NUMBER, EBAY, ADDRESS, FISHEYE, PETITION, EMAIL, FLAKE, BID, NAME, APPEAL, CALL, DRIVER, TELEPHOTO, MACRO, and FINLET.

First, I'll look for obvious groupings. Several words stand out as related to photography:
- FISHEYE refers to a type of ultra-wide-angle lens that creates a distorted, hemispherical image.
- TELEPHOTO refers to a lens that magnifies distant subjects for capturing details from far away.
- MACRO refers to a lens designed for extreme close-up photography, allowing detailed shots of small subjects.
- ZOOM is associated with zoom lenses, which allow variable focal lengths to adjust the field of view without changing lenses.

This group forms a clear category: "Types of camera lenses or specialized photography modes." FISHEYE, TELEPHOTO, and MACRO are unambiguously lens types, and ZOOM fits naturally as it describes a common feature of lenses that adjust focal length.

Now, considering other words:
- EBAY and BID might connect to online auctions, but no other obvious auction-related terms are present (e.g., only two words here).
- PETITION and APPEAL could be part of a legal or formal request category, but again, insufficient words to form a full group.
- NAME, ADDRESS, NUMBER, and EMAIL resemble fields for contact information, but NUMBER can be ambiguous (phone number vs. numeral).
- CALL and DRIVER have multiple meanings but don't form a strong category yet.
- FLAKE and FINLET are obscure; FLAKE could mean a snowflake or a person who is unreliable, and FINLET is a biological term for small fins on fish. Neither fits well with others.
- DRIVER might relate to golf or computing, but lacks supporting words.

The photography group (FISHEYE, TELEPHOTO, MACRO, ZOOM) is the most cohesive based on clear, common associations in photography. This should be my first guess, as it reduces ambiguity and leverages a well-known theme.

Confidence is high at 0.9 because the four words are strongly tied to photography, and similar categories appear frequently in Connections puzzles. If this is correct, I can focus on the remaining words in subsequent guesses.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- They all represent standard fields in contact forms or personal information profiles (e.g., name, address, email address, phone number). 
- This is a common Connections category, and other words like EBAY or CALL don't fit as well here (CALL could relate to phone calls but is less precise as a "field" than NUMBER for "phone number").

This grouping seems strong, with high cohesion and low ambiguity. Other potential categorizations (e.g., auction terms with EBAY/BID, legal requests with PETITION/APPEAL) don't have enough supporting words to form a full group yet.

I analyzed these words for potential connections:
- PETITION, APPEAL, BID, and CALL share a common theme of "making a formal or earnest request." 
  - PETITION: A formal written request, often signed by many people.
  - APPEAL: A serious or urgent request, often in legal or charitable contexts.
  - BID: An attempt to achieve or obtain something (e.g., "bid for attention" or "bid for support"), extending beyond auctions.
  - CALL: A demand or appeal for action (e.g., "call for justice" or "call to action").
- This grouping is cohesive, as all words can function as nouns describing types of solicitations or efforts to influence outcomes. 
- The remaining words (EBAY, FLAKE, DRIVER, FINLET) do not fit this category cleanly, but they can form another group later (e.g., EBAY and BID could relate to auctions, but BID is used here for its broader request connotation).

Confidence is 0.7 because while the connection is logical, it is slightly broader than typical Connections categories. If incorrect, I can reassess auction terms (EBAY/BID) or other themes with the feedback.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

These words appear unrelated at first glance, but after thorough analysis, a potential connection emerges: all can be loosely associated with fishing or marine contexts in specific, albeit stretched, ways.

- EBAY: As an online marketplace, it is a platform where fishing gear, equipment, or related items might be sold.
- FLAKE: Refers to a type of fish (e.g., in Australian English, "flake" is a common name for shark meat, often sold as fish and chips) or fish food flakes.
- DRIVER: Could relate to a "driver" in the context of fishing, such as a boat driver for fishing trips or a type of fishing lure/bait (e.g., "driver" lures used in angling).
- FINLET: A biological term for small fins on certain fish (e.g., tuna or mackerel), directly tied to fish anatomy.

This grouping is highly speculative and less intuitive than previous categories, as the connections rely on secondary or contextual meanings. Alternative interpretations were considered (e.g., technology, golf, or brands), but none formed a cohesive group. Given that these are the only words left, they must form the final category, likely "fishing-related terms" or "things associated with fish." Confidence is low due to the weak and indirect links, but it aligns with Connections' occasional use of niche categories.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The available words are: CRITICAL, PRIVATE, POUND, BILL, WON, SOLDIER, STERLING, PERSONAL, NICKEL, SECRET, PRINCIPAL, KEY, WING, INNER, MAJOR, DOLLAR.

I'll look for words with similar meanings, particularly around the idea of confidentiality or personal matters. 
- PRIVATE can mean not public or confidential.
- PERSONAL relates to individual matters or privacy.
- SECRET means hidden or confidential.
- INNER could refer to inner thoughts or feelings, which are often private.

These four words all connect to the theme of secrecy, confidentiality, or personal internal matters. Other words like CRITICAL, KEY, MAJOR, and PRINCIPAL seem to relate to importance, which could be a separate category. Currency-related words like POUND, DOLLAR, WON, and STERLING are another potential group, but for this guess, the privacy theme stands out as more cohesive with these words.

I'm not using PRIVATE in a military context here, as it fits better with secrecy for this group. SOLDIER might be part of a different group (e.g., military), but it doesn't belong in this one.

Confidence is high for this group, but INNER might be a slight stretch if not interpreted as "inner circle" or similar. Still, it's reasonable.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

These words are now removed from the available list.

Remaining words: CRITICAL, POUND, BILL, WON, SOLDIER, STERLING, NICKEL, PRINCIPAL, KEY, WING, MAJOR, DOLLAR

Now, I am focusing on identifying another group of four. Among the remaining words, several share a clear connection to the idea of "importance" or "essentiality":
- **CRITICAL**: Means vital, crucial, or of high importance.
- **KEY**: Refers to something fundamental, indispensable, or central.
- **PRINCIPAL**: Signifies something primary, main, or most important.
- **MAJOR**: Indicates something significant, serious, or of great importance.

These words are all strong synonyms for "important" in various contexts (e.g., critical role, key factor, principal reason, major issue). This category seems well-defined, as the words consistently convey centrality or high significance.

Other words do not fit as well in this group:
- Currency-like words (e.g., POUND, BILL, WON, STERLING, NICKEL, DOLLAR) could form their own category later, but they lack the "importance" connotation.
- SOLDIER and WING don't align with this theme, as they relate to military or structural concepts.

Confidence is high because the connection is semantic and consistent across all four words. However, "MAJOR" can also mean a military rank, which is a potential distractor, but its primary meaning as "significant" fits the importance theme better here.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I need to identify a group of four from these. Several words relate to currency:
- POUND: Refers to British currency (e.g., pound sterling).
- STERLING: Specifically denotes British currency when paired with "pound," but can stand alone as a currency term (e.g., "sterling" in financial contexts).
- DOLLAR: Currency used in the USA and other countries.
- WON: The currency of South Korea.

These four words share a common theme as names of currencies from different countries. The other words don't fit:
- BILL: Can refer to paper money (e.g., dollar bill) but is not a currency name itself.
- NICKEL: A coin denomination, not a currency name.
- SOLDIER: Relates to military, not currency.
- WING: Has various meanings (e.g., anatomical, structural) but no currency connection.

While STERLING is often part of "pound sterling," it is recognized independently in currency discussions. This group is cohesive and likely the intended category.

Confidence is high due to the clear semantic link, though BILL and NICKEL could be distractors for a different currency subgroup.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- Privacy/Confidentiality group: PRIVATE, PERSONAL, SECRET, INNER (known from first response).
- Importance group: CRITICAL, KEY, PRINCIPAL, MAJOR (confirmed in second response).
- Currencies group: POUND, STERLING, DOLLAR, WON (confirmed in third response).

The remaining words are: BILL, SOLDIER, NICKEL, WING. I must find a common category that connects these four words.

Analysis of the remaining words:
- **BILL**: Can be a verb meaning to charge or invoice (e.g., "The company will bill you later") or a noun (e.g., a banknote).
- **SOLDIER**: Can be used as a verb in phrasal verbs like "soldier on," meaning to persevere or continue steadfastly.
- **NICKEL**: Can be a verb meaning to plate with nickel or to overcharge in small amounts (e.g., "They were nickled and dimed").
- **WING**: Can be a verb meaning to improvise or do something with little preparation (e.g., "He had to wing the presentation").

The connection: All four words can function as verbs. While some verb usages are less common (e.g., "to soldier" is often part of "soldier on," and "to nickel" is somewhat dated or idiomatic), this grouping fits a pattern observed in NYT Connections, where word classes or less frequent usages are sometimes grouped. There are no other strong category candidates:
- Bill and nickel relate tangentially to money (e.g., bill as paper money, nickel as a coin), but soldier and wing do not fit a monetary theme.
- Soldier relates to the military, but no other words support this.
- Wing might be structural (e.g., building wing), but again, no commonality.
- Thus, the verb connection, though imperfect, is the most plausible.

Confidence is moderate (0.6) due to the varied familiarity of the verb forms. Some are secondary meanings, and this group might be a "Words That Are Verbs" or "Can Be Used As Verbs" category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

This group is cohesive and commonly featured in such puzzles. I considered other potential categories, such as protection (SHIELD, GUARD, PROTECTION, AEGIS), but AEGIS leans mythological and the malware group has stronger thematic consistency. Gum brands (EXTRA, ORBIT, ICE BREAKERS) were explored but lack a fourth word. Mythological symbols like LIGHTNING BOLT, TRIDENT, and AEGIS don't form a complete set with the available words.

Now, I need to identify the next category. The strongest grouping appears to be words related to **protection or defense**: 
- SHIELD: A physical or symbolic barrier for protection.
- GUARD: Someone or something that protects or watches over.
- PROTECTION: The act of defending or shielding from harm.
- AEGIS: A mythological term meaning "protection" or "support," often associated with a shield (e.g., "under the aegis of").

This category is cohesive and distinct from other possibilities. Alternative groupings were considered:
- **Gum brands**: EXTRA, ORBIT, ICE BREAKERS, and TRIDENT (as Trident gum) form a valid set, but this is less immediately obvious than protection.
- **Mythological symbols**: FLEUR-DE-LIS, TRIDENT, LIGHTNING BOLT, and AEGIS could fit, but AEGIS aligns better with protection, and FLEUR-DE-LIS is more heraldic than mythological.
- **Horses**: HORSESHOE and BUFFALO (as buffalo are sometimes confused with bison) lack a clear fourth word.

Given the clarity of the protection theme and the direct synonymity of these words, this is the highest-confidence guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The most prominent category among these is **gum/mint brands**:
- EXTRA: A well-known sugar-free gum brand.
- ORBIT: Formerly known as Orbit gum, a popular chewing gum.
- ICE BREAKERS: A brand of mints and gum.
- TRIDENT: A major gum brand (e.g., Trident gum).

This grouping is unambiguous and fits perfectly. Alternative categories were considered:
- **Symbols/emblems**: FLEUR-DE-LIS (heraldry), LIGHTNING BOLT (mythology/electricity), TRIDENT (mythology), HORSESHOE (luck). But TRIDENT is better suited to gum here.
- **Animals**: BUFFALO (animal) and HORSESHOE (relates to horses) lack a clear fourth word.

  - FLEUR-DE-LIS: Symbol of the New Orleans Saints (NFL team).
  - LIGHTNING BOLT: Symbol of the Los Angeles Chargers (NFL team).
  - HORSESHOE: Symbol of the Indianapolis Colts (NFL team).
This grouping is strong, as all words directly reference iconic NFL team symbols or identifiers. The puzzle often includes pop culture/sports categories.

Alternative considerations (but weaker):
- **Luck symbols**: HORSESHOE is a classic luck charm, but BUFFALO (animal/city) and LIGHTNING BOLT (danger) don't fit well.
- **Heraldry**: FLEUR-DE-LIS (French royalty) is heraldic, but LIGHTNING BOLT and HORSESHOE are less consistently associated, and BUFFALO is not typically heraldic.

This group of four words shares a clear thematic connection. Other words like "UNDER" don't fit as neatly into this category (it implies continuation or position, not finality). The remaining words will be addressed in future guesses.

Confidence is high because this is a common Connections category, but not absolute (1.0) since word senses can be context-dependent.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

For this guess, I need to identify another group of four related words. I notice potential sports-related terms:
- LAP can refer to a circuit in running, swimming, or racing.
- SHOT can denote an attempt in sports like basketball or a specific event like shot put.
- BELT is used in sports like weightlifting or martial arts (e.g., a weight belt or black belt).
- WATCH can relate to timing in sports, such as using a stopwatch for events.

This grouping shares a clear connection to athletics, sports equipment, or sports activities. While not perfectly exclusive, it's a reasonable fit given the words. 

Other possibilities were considered but dismissed:
- SNAIL and SLUG both fit a "slow animals" category, but only two words exist here, leaving others ungrouped.
- HARD TACO, M&amp;M, and EGG could be part of a "food" group, but GULP doesn't fit cleanly as a food item, and SHOT/BULL may have non-food meanings.
- DRINK-related terms like SHOT, GULP, and BELT (as in a drink of liquor) were explored, but LAP (for drinking) isn't a strong noun fit, and WATCH doesn't align.

Thus, sports/athletics is the strongest theme for this guess. Confidence is moderate due to some word flexibility, but the connection is logical.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The previous correct group was "finished/completed" (DONE, COMPLETE, OVER, THROUGH), so those are out. Now, I'm focusing on finding a new category. One strong theme emerges: terms related to consuming drinks or alcohol. Specifically:
- **SHOT**: Refers to a small serving of alcohol (e.g., a shot of whiskey).
- **GULP**: Describes a large swallow of a drink.
- **BELT**: Slang for a quick drink of liquor (e.g., "belt one down").
- **LAP**: Can mean to drink by licking or lapping up liquid (e.g., "the cat lapped up milk").

This group shares a clear connection to drinking actions or serving styles. Other words don't fit as well:
- SNAIL and SLUG could be a "slow animals" pair, but only two words exist.
- HARD TACO and M&amp;M are foods, but EGG (also food) doesn't align with the drinking theme.
- UNDER and WATCH have unrelated meanings (e.g., position/timekeeping).

Confidence is high because this is a common Connections category, and all four words have drink-related definitions. However, I'm slightly cautious due to the previous incorrect guess involving some of these words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

A promising category emerged: **things that have shells**. This is logical because:
- SNAIL has a calcium carbonate shell.
- EGG has a protective shell.
- HARD TACO explicitly refers to a taco with a crispy corn shell.
- M&amp;M candies are known for their colorful candy shells.

This group treats these words as literal or colloquial "shelled" items. SLUG (which lacks a shell) is excluded, supporting the validity of this group. Previously attempted categories like sports or drinking actions failed, so this contrast feels more reliable.

Other groupings were considered but rejected:
- Food items (e.g., including SLUG or GULP) don't form a clear quartet.
- Animals (SNAIL, SLUG, BULL) lacks a fourth member and EGG doesn't fit.
- Prepositions like UNDER can't form a group since OVER and THROUGH are already used.

Confidence is strong due to the thematic consistency, though slightly lower than 1.0 due to potential ambiguity in M&amp;M (if not universally recognized as "shelled").</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- **SHOT**: Refers to a projectile fired from a gun or ammunition.
- **SLUG**: A type of bullet, especially a heavy shotgun projectile.
- **BULL**: Short for "bullet" in informal contexts (e.g., "full metal jacket bull").
- **BELT**: Refers to an ammunition belt used in machine guns.

This grouping is cohesive and avoids overlap with previous categories. Other interpretations were considered but rejected:

Re-evaluating all options reveals a strong theme: **informal terms for consuming drinks**. This avoids previous pitfalls:
- **GULP**: A large swallow of liquid (e.g., "take a gulp of water").
- **SHOT**: A small serving of liquor (e.g., "a shot of tequila").
- **BELT**: Slang for drinking alcohol quickly (e.g., "belt down a beer").
- **SLUG**: A heavy draft of liquid, usually alcohol (e.g., "slug of whiskey").

This grouping focuses purely on drinking actions, solving prior inconsistencies:
- LAP (previously included) doesn’t strongly fit this context beyond animal behavior.  
- BULL/WATCH/UNDER remain ungrouped for later analysis.  

Other connections were rejected:  
- UNDER lacks thematic partners (preposition category depleted).  
- BULL diverges toward animal/idioms (e.g., bull market), not drinks.  
- WATCH has stronger ties to time/surveillance.

- LAP can mean a circuit (e.g., in racing) or the area on one's legs.
- BULL typically refers to the animal, financial optimism (bull market), or brute force.
- UNDER is a preposition indicating position/subordination.
- WATCH relates to timekeeping or surveillance.

However, deeper analysis reveals a consistent theme of **police/surveillance terminology**:
- **LAP**: Refers to the LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department), a widely recognized police force.
- **BULL**: Slang for a police officer or detective (e.g., "The bulls are coming").
- **UNDER**: Short for "undercover," a common tactic in police investigations.

- **AREAL**: Pertains to measurement of area (2D space)
- **LINEAR**: Pertains to straight lines or one-dimensional measurement
- **ANGULAR**: Pertains to angles or curvature
- **VOLUMETRIC**: Pertains to measurement of volume (3D space)

This group stands out as a strong thematic cluster in mathematics/physics. The remaining words (ROUNDOFF, ARABESQUE, SPLIT, AERIAL) likely form a separate group related to gymnastics/dance moves, but I'll address that in a future guess if this is correct. The geometric group has high confidence due to precise term alignment.

Alternative groupings (e.g., homophones or verbs) were considered but dismissed. For instance:

My first step is to identify the most obvious category to test, as this can help narrow down the board quickly.

One strong thematic group appears to be words associated with physical structures or supports that are often vertical and used in architecture, engineering, or everyday contexts. Specifically:
- "COLUMN" can refer to a vertical pillar in buildings, like a Doric column.
- "PILLAR" is a synonym for a supportive vertical structure, such as a pillar in a temple.
- "POST" often denotes an upright pole, like a fence post or signpost.
- "POLE" fits as a type of long, slender vertical object, such as a flagpole or utility pole.

All four words share this common theme of structural elements, making this a high-confidence category. Other potential groups (e.g., business terms like STAKE/SHARE/INTEREST, or attention verbs like OBSERVE/FOLLOW) will be easier to confirm or rule out once this group is tested. There's a slight chance "POST" could relate to social media or "POLE" to geography, but in context, the structural meaning is most consistent.

The next clearest thematic cluster appears to be **finance/business ownership terms**:
- **SHARE**: Refers to a unit of ownership in a company (e.g., stock share).
- **STAKE**: Represents a financial interest or investment (e.g., owning a stake in a business).
- **PERCENTAGE**: Indicates a proportional ownership or cut of profits (e.g., taking a percentage).
- **INTEREST**: Can denote a legal/financial claim (e.g., ownership interest) or returns on capital.

These all align tightly with concepts of ownership, investment, or profit-sharing. While "PERCENTAGE" has mathematical uses, its synergy with financial terms here is strong.

- **FOLLOW**: To pay close attention to or track (e.g., "follow instructions" or "follow the news").

This group has cohesive semantics, as all four words share the core idea of focused attention. Alternative groupings like "information-type nouns" (e.g., INFORMATION, INTELLIGENCE, SECRETS, DIRT) would leave MIND/OBSERVE/FOLLOW/REGARD with less clear connections, as MIND can be a noun in other contexts but fits perfectly here as a verb. The remaining words (DIRT, INFORMATION, INTELLIGENCE, SECRETS) form a plausible "types of information" category if this guess is correct. Confidence is high due to clear linguistic overlap in verb usage.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

These words form a cohesive thematic group centered on **types of information or knowledge**, often with connotations of secrecy, value, or exclusivity:
- **DIRT**: Colloquially refers to scandalous or confidential information (e.g., "gossip" or "inside dirt").
- **INFORMATION**: General term for facts, data, or knowledge.
- **INTELLIGENCE**: Specifically denotes strategic or secret information (e.g., military or espionage intelligence).
- **SECRETS**: Explicitly refers to confidential, undisclosed knowledge.

The connection is robust—all describe forms of knowledge, with DIRT/INTELLIGENCE/SECRETS emphasizing hidden or privileged insights. Alternative interpretations (e.g., DIRT as soil) don't align contextually, reinforcing this grouping. Since these are the last words, confidence is extremely high.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

My goal is to identify a group of four words that share a common category. 

First, I notice words related to expression or communication: VOICE (as in giving voice to an opinion), SAY (to express verbally), SPEAK (to talk), and VOTE (as a formal expression of choice). These seem to fit a category like "ways to express or communicate" or "forms of participation." Checking other words, CHOICE might be related but is not as directly tied to active expression like the others. 

This group might not be perfect because VOTE could also be seen as more decision-focused, but the connection seems plausible. I need to test a guess to get feedback, so I'll start with this. If incorrect, the response will provide clues for refinement.

Other potential groups to explore later include:
- Footwear: HEEL (as in high heels), PUMP (a type of shoe), FLAT (flat shoes), and possibly WAFFLE (referring to shoe soles, like in sneakers), but the last one is weaker.
- Car or mechanical terms: TIRE, PUMP (for inflation), but with SHAKE not fitting well.
- Food/drink: SHAKE (milkshake), WAFFLE, STEAM (steamed food), but no clear fourth word.

For now, I'll proceed with the communication theme for my first guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The available words are: WHOLE, CHOICE, TIRE, QUARTER, NATURAL, STEAM, SHAKE, FLAT, HEEL, WAFFLE, PUMP, DOWN. 

I focused on a promising theme: **types or styles of shoes**. This category fits several words:
- **HEEL**: Refers to "high heel" shoes.
- **PUMP**: A style of women's shoe (e.g., ballet pump).
- **FLAT**: Refers to "flat shoes" like loafers or ballet flats.
- **WAFFLE**: Not obvious, but in footwear, it describes a textured sole pattern found in athletic shoes (e.g., "waffle sole" in sneakers). While this usage is slightly niche, it's a recognized term in shoe design, making it a plausible fit for the category.

Other potential groups were considered but discarded:
- Shoe-related words like TIRE (could imply "tired" shoes, but not consistent) or DOWN (e.g., down boots, but not a common shoe type).
- Verb-based categories (e.g., SHAKE, PUMP, STEAM, TIRE) were too broad and inconsistent.
- Food connections (e.g., WAFFLE, SHAKE, STEAM) lacked a clear fourth member.

This shoe category seems cohesive, though I acknowledge WAFFLE might be a weaker link. A successful "INCORRECT" response here would provide clues for refinement, such as whether WAFFLE is misclassified. Confidence is moderately high due to the clear shoe associations for HEEL, PUMP, and FLAT.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Previous attempts focused on communication (spoken expression) and footwear, which failed, suggesting the correct category might be less obvious. 

I now see a potential category: **"food-related terms."** 
- **WHOLE**: Often used descriptively for food, e.g., "whole milk" or "whole foods."
- **CHOICE**: Refers to higher-quality grades in food items, like "choice beef."
- **STEAM**: A cooking method, e.g., "steamed vegetables."
- **SHAKE**: A type of drink, like a "milkshake."

This connection seems plausible, though weaker than desired. If incorrect, the feedback may help narrow down remaining groups. Other possibilities exist, like mathematical terms (WHOLE number, NATURAL number), but NATURAL and QUARTER don't align cleanly (QUARTER note exists but pairs poorly with NATURAL), or sports terms, but no strong group emerged. With limited guesses, testing this provides new information. Confidence remains low due to potential overextension of the food theme.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Since these are the only four words left unguessed, they must form the final category by default. However, identifying a clear connection is challenging:

- **TIRE**: Primarily a noun (e.g., car tire) or verb (to become weary).
- **QUARTER**: Can be a noun (e.g., one-fourth, a coin, or a period in sports), a verb (to divide into four), or an adjective.
- **NATURAL**: Typically an adjective (e.g., occurring in nature) or a noun (e.g., a person with innate talent).
- **DOWN**: Can be an adverb (e.g., downward direction), adjective (e.g., feeling down), noun (e.g., soft feathers), or verb (e.g., to drink quickly).

Potential categories considered:
- **Verbs**: TIRE (to exhaust), QUARTER (to lodge), and DOWN (to drink) could fit, but NATURAL lacks a common verb usage.
- **States/conditions**: TIRE (tired state), DOWN (low mood), NATURAL (innate state), but QUARTER doesn't align well.
- **Physical objects**: TIRE (car part), DOWN (feathers), but QUARTER (coin) and NATURAL (not an object) are inconsistent.
- **Wordplay/phrases**: "Flat TIRE" is common, but no obvious links for the others (e.g., "quarter DOWN" in football is niche, "natural DOWN" isn't standard).

The connection remains elusive, but with only one guess left and no other options, this must be the group. Confidence is low due to the unclear theme.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
