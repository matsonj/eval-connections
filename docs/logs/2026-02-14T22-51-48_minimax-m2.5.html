Available words: CANDLE, EAR, SEAL, HONEYCOMB, CRAYON, STALK, ENGINE, WING, BULB, STIFF, HEAD, HOSE, NOSE, ROB, FLEECE, CABIN

Let me group by potential categories:

1. BODY PARTS: EAR, HEAD, NOSE - These are three facial features that could logically form a group of 4. What's the fourth? SEAL (no), CANDLE (no), ROB could be "head" as in "rob" - no.

Wait - let me reconsider. HEAD, EAR, NOSE could be a category, and I need to find what connects them. They are all things that can be "red" - RED HEAD (a person with red hair), RED NOSE, RED EAR? That's a stretch.

2. LIGHT SOURCES: CANDLE, BULB - only 2

3. ANIMALS: SEAL - only 1

4. VEHICLE PARTS: ENGINE, WING - only 2

5. Let me think of another approach - what can combine with words to make compound words? 
&bull; HEAD: can be part of HEADLIGHTS, HEADPHONES, HEADSET... 
&bull; NOSE: can be part of NOSEGAY, NOSEHARE...
&bull; EAR: can be part of EARPHONES, EARDRUM...

Actually, I think HEAD, NOSE, and EAR are strong candidates as a category - they're all facial features. Let me try to find a 4th that makes sense. What about CANDLE? No.

Let me reconsider - maybe BODY PARTS is the category and I need to find another one. Or maybe there's something else.

Wait - what about words that rhyme or have similar sounds? Or words that can be preceded/followed by the same word?

Actually, let me try HEAD, NOSE, EAR plus maybe CANDLE? No...

Let me go with what seems most logical: HEAD, NOSE, and EAR are clearly related as facial/body parts. Let me think about what fourth might fit. Maybe STALK? No. What about CRAYON? No.

Actually, I think I should try EAR, HEAD, NOSE as my guess and see what feedback I get.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Wait - let me consider WING as the 4th word. HEAD, EAR, NOSE, and WING could all be body parts (HEAD, EAR, NOSE are human facial features, WING is a body part of a bird/insect/airplane). This could be the category "body parts" or specifically "parts of a creature."

Alternatively, let me think of other possibilities:
&bull; Could it be SEAL? No, that's an animal.
&bull; Could it be STALK? No.
&bull; Could it be CRAYON, CANDLE, BULB? These are things that produce light.

Let me think of other groupings:

1. HONEYCOMB, CANDLE, and BULB could all relate to light or bees/wax - honeycomb is from bees, candles can be made from beeswax

2. CABIN, ENGINE, WING - parts of an airplane! That's 3. Need a 4th - HOSE? No. What else?

3. CRAYON, CANDLE, BULB - all can produce something (crayon draws, candle burns, bulb lights)

4. Let me think about what can be "soft": FLEECE is soft, but what else?

5. What about words that rhyme? No obvious rhymes.

6. What about "wax" - CANDLE (wax candle), BULB (wax bulb? no), HONEYCOMB (beeswax)

Wait - CANDLE, HONEYCOMB, and what else relates to bees/wax? Actually bees are involved in both honeycomb and candles (beeswax). Let me try that category.

Actually, wait - CANDLE and HONEYCOMB both relate to BEES/WAX. What else? Could BULB work? No.

Let me try CABIN, ENGINE, WING as parts of a plane - and add HOSE? No. Actually, a CABIN, ENGINE, and WING are all parts of an airplane. What's the 4th?

Actually, let me try words that can be preceded by "balloon": No.

Let me try something different - words that rhyme with "sea": No.

Wait - what about STIFF, STALK - no.

Actually, I should try CABIN, ENGINE, WING, and... HOSE? No.

Let me try FLEECE, STALK, CRAYON, BULB - no obvious category.

Actually, let me try CANDLE, BULB, HONEYCOMB - all things with light or related to bees. The 4th might be... SEAL? No.

What about: CANDLE, BULB - both produce light. NOSE, EAR, HEAD - body parts. 

Let me try: CANDLE, HONEYCOMB - both related to bees. What about SEAL - no.

I'll go with CABIN, ENGINE, WING as airplane parts and add HOSE - no that doesn't work. What about ROB? No.

Let me reconsider more systematically. The last guess didn't work. Let me think about what could form a category of 4:

Looking at the words again:
CANDLE, EAR, SEAL, HONEYCOMB, CRAYON, STALK, ENGINE, WING, BULB, STIFF, HEAD, HOSE, NOSE, ROB, FLEECE, CABIN

Let me try different groupings:

1. CABIN, ENGINE, WING - airplane parts. What could be the 4th? HOSE doesn't fit. 

2. CANDLE, BULB - light sources. Need 2 more.

3. FLEECE - soft material. What else is soft? STIFF is the opposite. 

Wait - what about FLEECE, STALK, CRAYON, CANDLE - no obvious link.

Wait - what about CRAYON - you can DRAW with it. STALK - you can STALK someone. But no.

Actually, let me reconsider: CABIN, ENGINE, WING, and HOSE - they could all be parts of vehicles or things that transport people! CABIN (part of plane), ENGINE (power), WING (part of plane), HOSE - no that doesn't fit.

Let me try FLEECE, STIFF, STALK, CRAYON - no.

Wait - I wonder if the category is "things that can be found in a bedroom" or "things that are red"? No.

Let me try FLEECE, CABIN, CRAYON, STALK - no.

Actually, let me try CABIN, ENGINE, WING and see if there's a 4th that I'm missing. What about SEAL? No.

Wait - I haven't tried CANDLE, BULB as light sources. What about adding HEADLIGHT? That's not here. What about EAR as in earring? No.

Let me try STALK, CRAYON, CANDLE, BULB - no.

I need to find a group of 4 that clearly works. Let me try something new - maybe words related to bees/wax: CANDLE, HONEYCOMB, and what else? BULB?&lt;guess&gt;

Wait - I haven't tried focusing on the airplane parts theory. CABIN, ENGINE, WING - these are 3 parts of an airplane. What could be the 4th? 

Actually, let me think differently - what about parts of a CAR: CABIN (car's interior), ENGINE, HOSE (for fluids), and... what else? WHEEL would fit but not here.

Wait - what about all being parts of different vehicles? CABIN (plane), ENGINE (various), WING (plane), HOSE (could be in any vehicle) - this doesn't work as a tight category.

Let me reconsider the body parts: HEAD, EAR, NOSE - what could be the 4th?

Actually, wait - I haven't tried STALK as part of a body. No.

What about: CANDLE, BULB, CRAYON - these can all be described as having a "tip" or "point"? No.

Looking at the words: PEEL, HIKE, BUNK, TAIL, POWERS, HUNT, WALK, ARCHER, FISH, RAISE, BALONEY, CRANK, BULL, NAP, JACK, RUBBISH

Let me consider potential groupings:

1. Words meaning "nonsense" or "lies": BUNK, BALONEY, RUBBISH - these three are synonyms!

2. Words that can follow "bull": BULL + DOG, BULL + FROG, etc. But we have BUNK, TAIL, CRANK...

3. Words related to physical activities: HIKE, WALK, HUNT, FISH

4. Words that can be verbs AND nouns: Most of them can

Wait - I notice BUNK, BALONEY, and RUBBISH are all synonyms meaning "nonsense" or "lies". That's a strong category!

Let me think about what could complete this category of 4. What other words mean nonsense or rubbish?
&bull; BUNK (short for bunkum, nonsense)
&bull; BALONEY (nonsense, nonsense talk)
&bull; RUBBISH (nonsense, trash)

I need one more word that means nonsense. Looking at remaining words... CRANK could mean "nonsense" (as in "crank ideas"). Or perhaps POWERS could relate? No, that doesn't fit.

Actually, let me reconsider. Could there be another category? Let me think about words that can all be preceded by certain prefixes or followed by certain suffixes...

Wait - what about words that can come after "jack" or form compound words with other common words?
&bull; JACK + TAIL = JACKTAIL (a bird)
&bull; JACK + CRANK doesn't work
&bull; BULL + nothing

Hmm, let me think differently. What about words that can all describe types of animals or animal characteristics?
&bull; FISH, BULL, ARCHER (no)

Let me try another approach: words that rhyme or have similar sounds? Not really working.

Let me go with the strongest category I see: BUNK, BALONEY, RUBBISH = all meaning "nonsense". The fourth could be CRANK (as in "crank ideas" or "that's a crank theory" meaning nonsense in some contexts, though less common). Actually wait - CRANK as a noun can mean "an eccentric person with strange ideas" - close to nonsense.

Looking for other potential categories:

1. Words that can follow "bull": BULL + DOG, BULL + FROG, BULL + DOZER... We have TAIL, CRANK - don't work.

2. Words that can precede specific other words:

Two wrong guesses so far. Let me try to find a different connection.

Wait - let me think about compound words or words that can follow certain prefixes:

What about words that come after "SAND"? SAND + FISH = anglerfish... not helpful.

What about words that rhyme or sound similar? 

Actually, wait - let me think about things you can do with your hands:
&bull; PEEL (peel an orange)
&bull; RAISE (raise your hand)
&bull; HUNT (hunt with hands)
&bull; FISH (fish with hands/line)

That doesn't seem right either.

Let me think about things you can "catch":
&bull; FISH (catch fish)
&bull; HUNT (catch prey)
&bull; CRANK (crank something? catch as in get?)

Hmm. 

What about thinking about JACK differently - what words commonly follow "JACK"?
&bull; JACK + TAIL = jaeger (a bird), also "jacktail" 
&bull; JACK + FISH - no

Wait! Could it be words that can all follow "JACK"? We have TAIL (jacktail), but what's the pattern? Not clear.

Let me think about another angle: what if there's a category based on homophones or similar sounds?

Actually, let me try a different grouping - words that can come after "COW":
COW + TAIL = cowtail? Not really.

Wait - what about "PEEL", "HULL", "SKIN"... we don't have hull or skin. We do have PEEL and... not matching.

Let me try: WALK, HIKE, STRIDE... but we don't have stride.

What about RAISE, LOWER, LIFT... RAISE is there but not the others.

Actually, wait - let me think about PEEL, HULL, SHUCK, SKIN - all things you remove from food. PEEL is there. What else?

Hmm, we don't have HULL or SHUCK or SKIN though.

Let me try something else: What about things that can be "COLD"? COLD + FISH, COLD + BULL... no.

Actually - what about words that can be types of "TALK"? 
&bull; BUNK (bunkum - meaningless talk)
&bull; BALONEY (meaningless talk)
&bull; RUBBISH (nonsense)
But that's still the same category I tried before.

Let me try: FISH, BULL, ARCHER - all can be preceded by "SCOTTISH" (Scottish fish, Scottish bull, Scottish archer?) No.

Wait - what about all being something you can "GO" or "BE" or "GET"?
&bull; GO FISHING, GO HUNTING, GO WALKING, GO HIKING

These are all "GO + VERB + ING" activities! FISH, HUNT, WALK, HIKE - all are activities you can do.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me think about what words can describe actions or activities:
&bull; WALK, HIKE, HUNT, FISH - these are activities (I already tried these)

But wait - what about adding NAP to activities? Actually, NAP is also an activity (to nap). And PEEL is an activity (to peel).

So could it be: WALK, HIKE, HUNT, NAP? Or PEEL, HUNT, WALK, NAP?

Actually, wait - all these are things you can DO as activities:
&bull; WALK

Let me group by potential categories:

1. Underwear types: THONG, BOXER, BRIEF (3 words)
2. Counterculture terms: BOHEMIAN, HIPSTER, PUNK, FLAPPER (4 words) - these all describe non-mainstream lifestyles
3. Prank/deception: TRICK, PRANK, FOOL (3 words)

I notice there could be more connections. Let me think about alternative meanings or other connections:

Actually, wait - could there be words with double meanings? Let me reconsider:
&bull; BABA could be "Baba Yaga" (folklore) or "baba" (cake)
&bull; HANDLE could be a bar/handle like on a pitcher, or a username
&bull; CHAIN could be jewelry (chain) or a series
&bull; FLOAT could be a decorative display or buoyant object

Let me try a different approach. I notice FLAPPER, PUNK, HIPSTER, BOHEMIAN are all types of people/styles from different eras:
&bull; FLAPPER = 1920s
&bull; PUNK = 1970s-80s
&bull; HIPSTER = 1940s-50s, revived 2000s
&bull; BOHEMIAN = 19th century onwards

Let me reconsider the words more carefully:

TRICK, HOTEL, PRANK, BOHEMIAN, HIPSTER, STAIRWAY, CHAIN, FOOL, THONG, FLAPPER, BOXER, BRIEF, PUNK, HANDLE, BABA, FLOAT

The underwear category (THONG, BOXER, BRIEF) seems correct but I picked the wrong 4th word. Let me think about what could complete this group.

Actually, wait - I'm not getting feedback on which specific words are wrong. Let me try another category completely.

Let me look for words with multiple meanings:
&bull; CHAIN could be jewelry or a series
&bull; FLOAT could be a parade float or to float on water
&bull; HANDLE could be on a cup or a username
&bull; BABA could be a type of cake or a folklore character
&bull; PUNK could be music or a person
&bull; HOTEL - seems pretty straightforward

Wait - could STAIRWAY and CHAIN go together? Or what about a different grouping?

Actually, let me try another approach. What about words that can come after other words to make compound terms?
&bull; FIRE + TRICK = fire trick
&bull; HOTEL + ??? 
&bull; BOXER - could be a fighter or shorts

Actually, wait - could all these be things that can be described with a color? No...

Let me try the counterculture group again: BO&lt;guess&gt;
BOHEMIAN, HIPSTER, PUNK, FLAPPER&lt;/guess&gt;

I have 1 guess remaining.

Looking at the words again: TRICK, HOTEL, PRANK, BOHEMIAN, HIPSTER, STAIRWAY, CHAIN, FOOL, THONG, FLAPPER, BOXER, BRIEF, PUNK, HANDLE, BABA, FLOAT

Wait - let me think about different meanings. Could some of these be compound words or have secondary meanings?

Actually, I notice this could be about types of people or character archetypes:
&bull; FOOL - a character type
&bull; PUNK - a type of person
&bull; HIPSTER - a type of person  
&bull; BOHEMIAN - a type of person

But that was marked incorrect.

Let me think about other possible categories. What about words related to magic or performance? TRICK, PRANK...

Actually, wait. Let me reconsider the underwear category: THONG, BOXER, BRIEF. What if I try PUNK? No that doesn't work.

Hmm, what about words that could be combined with "HOTEL"? Like "HOTEL TRICK" - no that's not a thing.

Wait - what if the fourth word is actually FOOL? That would give me TRICK, PRANK, FOOL... and what else?

Actually, I realize I may be overthinking. Let me go back to what I know is a solid category - the underwear one: THONG, BOXER, BRIEF. Let me try adding another word that might work...

Actually, wait - could it be that all these are types of something I'm not seeing? Or maybe words that have something in common like "can be a verb AND a noun"? Let me think...

Oh! Wait - what about words that can come AFTER other words? Like:
&bull; FIRE TRICK
&bull; HOTEL PRANK? No
&bull; BEACH FLOAT? Maybe
&bull; CUP HANDLE? Yes

Actually I have just ONE guess left. Let me try: TRICK, PRANK, FOOL... hmm. The obvious missing word from that group would be... wait, those ARE the three!

Wait, I think there's only 3 prank-related words. Let me try a completely different approach.

What about: STAIRWAY, HOTEL, CHAIN, FLOAT - all could be things in a hotel? That's weak.

Let me try: HANDLE, THONG, BOXER, BRIEF - all can be worn/held? That's also weak.

Actually, I really think the underwear category is correct. Let me just try one more combination with different words: THONG, BOXER, BRIEF and... what about FLOAT? No.

Wait - could BRIEF also be "brief" as in short? And THONG as in shoe? Still doesn't help.

I need to try something new with my last guess. Let me think of words that could be combined with the others to make common phrases. 

Actually - what about FOOL, TRICK, PRANK... and wait - could PUNK work? Like "punk" someone? Not really.

Hmm. Could it be that these are all things you can do with your hands or something?

Let me think one more time: maybe I should try words that rhyme or sound similar?

Actually, I have no choice - I'll try the underwear category with a different fourth word.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I'm looking for a category of 4 related words. Let me explore groupings:

1. <b>Words that can be preceded by "PEN"</b>: pen-___ (pen name, pen pal, pen holder)
2. <b>Words that can be preceded by "WHITE"</b>: white rose, white squid (calamari), white watch, white track
3. <b>Communication/legal terms</b>: ROGER (communication), JUROR (legal), WATCH (as in watch your back), FOLLOW (follow instructions)

Actually, let me think about things that are "types of":
&bull; TRIX (cereal)
&bull; DONUT (pastry)
&bull; SQUID (seafood)
&bull; None match as a clean category

What about things that can follow "WHITE":
&bull; WHITE ROSE, WHITE TRACK, WHITE MONITOR, WHITE WATCH

Wait - "pen" can go before: pen ROSE? No. pen TRACK? No.

Let me reconsider: What about things that come AFTER "PEN" as in "pen ___":
&bull; pen PAL, pen NAME, pen TEST, penmanship

Hmm, none of these match. What about "track"? 
&bull; RACE track, music track, tracking

Let me try: FOLLOW, WATCH, ROGER, JUROR - are these all things you might do or people involved in a trial/legal proceeding? Not quite.

Actually, let me look at "WHITE" as a modifier for:
&bull; WHITE ROSE, WHITE TRACK, WHITE MONITOR, WHITE WATCH

These all work! A white rose (flower), white track (running), white monitor (computer), white watch (timepiece). They are all things that can be described as white.

&bull; FOLLOW TRACK (yes - follow a track/song)

What about "MONTH" things:
&bull; MONTH TRACK (no)
&bull; MONTH JUROR (no)

Wait - could these be things you do with a computer/printer?
PRINTER, MONITOR, PEN, TATTOO MACHINE (used for printing tattoos) - connected to images/printing?

But that leaves 12 other words.

&bull; JUROR (yes)
&bull; WATCH (watch a trial)
&bull; FOLLOW (follow a case)
&bull; TRIAL (not there)

Hmm.

What about "ROGER" in radio communication - you might ROGER a message, you FOLLOW instructions, you WATCH something, you TRACK something. These are all ways of processing information/receiving communications?

&bull; WATCH (you can watch a trial)
&bull; FOLLOW (follow a case)

&bull; PRINTER (printing)
&bull; MONITOR (displaying art)

I tried that already.

Let me think about something completely different. What about types of things:
&bull; DONUT (food)
&bull; SQUID (food)
&bull; TRIX (cereal)
&bull; ROSE (flower)

These are all types of things! Food/cereal/flower - not matching.

Wait - what about things that can come after "pen":
pen name, pen pal, pen holder... none of these are available.

Actually, let me reconsider my first guess. I had WHITE, ROSE, MONITOR, WATCH. Could it be that WHITE needs to be paired differently?

What about: SQUID, JUROR, TRACK, TATTOO MACHINE - all from SQUID GAME? There's a juror, a track (the games), and tattoo machine. But SQUID is the show name.

WAFFLE, CHOICE, SHAKE, STEAM, NATURAL, WHOLE, DOWN, FLAT, PUMP, QUARTER, HEEL, TIRE, VOTE

Let me try a different approach. Looking for words that can follow "flat":
&bull; FLAT TIRE ✓
&bull; FLAT HEEL ✓
&bull; FLAT... what else?

Or maybe words that can follow "down":
&bull; DOWN FLAT (as in "lay down flat") ✓
&bull; DOWN WHOLE (not common)
&bull; DOWN NATURAL (not common)

Wait - let me think about words that combine with "pump":
&bull; PUMP (you can pump a tire)
&bull; Not really working

Let me think about verbs: SHAKE, VOTE, SPEAK (removed), SAY (removed) - these are actions you can do.

Actually, let me try a different category entirely - things related to a car/wheel:
&bull; TIRE, PUMP, QUARTER (for parking), WHOLE (whole car?) - not convincing

What about "natural" combinations?
&bull; NATURAL WHOLE (like whole natural foods) ✓
&bull; This could work!

Let me try: WHOLE, NATURAL, and think about food-related:
&bull; WAFFLE, SHAKE, STEAM - all food items! ✓

So we could have: WAFFLE, SHAKE, STEAM (all food items you can make/eat) plus one more?

Wait - that's only 3. Let me reconsider.

Actually let me try looking at words that can be verbs vs nouns:
Most are nouns, but SHAKE, VOTE, CHOICE can also be verbs.

Let me try: CHOICE, VOTE, SHAKE, SPEAK (removed) - all can be verbs

Hmm, I need to try something different. Let me try the "flat" combinations again with fresh eyes:
FLAT, DOWN, WHOLE, NATURAL - these could all be states/descriptions.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

&bull; TIRE and HEEL are both parts of/related to footwear
&bull; PUMP is also a type of shoe (like high heels are called pumps)
&bull; FLAT can describe both a FLAT TIRE and FLAT HEEL (flat-soled shoes)

So TIRE, HEEL, PUMP, FLAT - all relate to feet/shoes/footwear!

Let me verify:

&bull; SHAKE (you shake to mix/create)
&bull; PUMP (you pump to create pressure)
&bull; STEAM (steam is created by heating water)

Actually wait - let me think about "choice" differently. In word puzzles, sometimes categories are about compound words or word pairings.

Let me think about what can follow each word:
&bull; STEAM (steamboat, steam engine, steam press)
&bull; WHOLE (whole milk, whole wheat)
&bull; NATURAL (natural gas, natural resources)
&bull; WAFFLE (waffle iron, waffle cone)

What about words that can follow "ice"?
&bull; ICE WAFFLE (waffle with ice cream) ✓
&bull; ICE SHAKE (no)
&bull; ICE QUARTER (no)

Hmm... Let me try thinking about categories differently. What about things you do with your hands:
PUMP (pump up), SHAKE (shake hands), VOTE (vote with hands), WHOLE (hold whole?)

Actually let me try: WAFFLE, SHAKE, STEAM, QUARTER - all relate to "hand" in some way:
&bull; HandSHAKE ✓
&bull; Steam... hmm

Wait - I got it! Words related to money/payment:
QUARTER, VOTE (vote with coins in ancient times?), CHOICE (choice is related to paying), PUMP (pump prices?) - not working

&bull; Words that can follow "sweet": STAR (sweet star), DREAM, etc.
&bull; Words that are both nouns and verbs: DUCK, DIVE, DODGE, DIP, CHIP, FRY, WING, SCRAPER, RAM

The action words (DIP, DIVE, DUCK, DODGE) seem promising - they all involve quick downward or avoiding movements. But I should consider what other categories might exist.

Wait - let me consider "things with wings" or things that can "fly": FLYER, LARK, DUCK, WING, ROCKET. But ROCKET is different.

Let me go with the action-based category: DIP, DIVE, DUCK, DODGE - all are verbs related to lowering or avoiding something quickly. This seems like a solid category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me try a different approach. What about words that can all follow "hair"? Let me think... You can DYE hair, you can SET hair, you can CURL hair... but none of those are in the list.

Wait - what about "things you do with a pan"? You can FRY, you can... 

Actually, let me look at words that are types of moves in sports/combat:
&bull; DODGE, DUCK, DIVE - these are evasive actions

Let me think about this differently. What about words that can all be preceded by something? 

Actually, I notice "LINCOLN" and "SENATOR" - both political. "FORD" and "DODGE" - both car brands. "ROCKET" and "STAR" - both space-related.

What about words that can follow "road": 
&bull; ROAD? Not really

Wait - what about things you can get "hit by"? No.

Let me try: FLYER, STAR, ROCKET, LARK - all things related to the sky/flight/air. But ROCKET is also a space thing.

3. Cooking terms: FRY, DIP, (SCRAPER could be for cooking?) - only 2
4. Animals: LARK, DUCK, RAM - 3

Let me reconsider things that fly. What if it's specifically birds? LARK, DUCK, (maybe not WING - that's a body part). 

Actually, wait - let me check if there's a category about "things that can be preceded by 'talking'": talking HEAD? Talking DUCK? No.

What about words that are all names of animals' young? 
&bull; LARK - baby is chick
&bull; DUCK - baby is duckling  
&bull; RAM - baby is lamb

No that's not it.

Wait - let me think about "RAM" and "CHIP" - both computer terms! And what about "DODGE" as in "Dodge RAM" is a truck! So maybe: RAM, CHIP, DODGE, and what else? But FORD and LINCOLN are also car brands...

Let me try a new angle. What about words that rhyme? Or words that end with the same sound?

Actually, let me think about "SENATOR" and "LINCOLN" - both are names of U.S. presidents! And we also have "FORD" - also a president! So: LINCOLN, FORD, and... SENATOR isn't a president name, but Garfield was a congressman... No.

Wait - what about just "FLYER" as something that flies through the air (like a pamphlet), "ROCKET" flies, "WING" enables flight, "LARK" is a bird that flies. That's 4!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

&bull; Car brands: FORD, DODGE, LINCOLN (3)
&bull; Cooking: FRY, DIP (2)
&bull; Political: SENATOR, LINCOLN (2)
&bull; Animals/birds: LARK, DUCK, RAM (3)

Wait - I just realized something! "CHIP" and "RAM" are both computer terms/memory! And "DODGE" could refer to "Dodge RAM" which is a truck. But that's still only 3.

What about: "FLYER" can mean a pamphlet, "STAR" can mean a celebrity, "ROCKET" can mean a spacecraft, "LARK" can mean a bird - no clear connection.

Wait - let me think about "DODGE" and "DIVE" and "DUCK" as words that START with "D" - no, DUCK doesn't start with D, DIP doesn't either.

Actually, what if the category is things associated with "American presidents"? LINCOLN, FORD (Gerald Ford was president), and what else? SENATOR isn't a president.

Wait - what about "things you can make with a vehicle"? Like you can FORD a river, DODGE traffic, ROCKET somewhere...

Actually, let me try the car brands: FORD, DODGE, LINCOLN plus... what about "SCRAPER" - no, not a car brand. Maybe "WING" - no.

Hmm, let me try thinking about what these words can have in common semantically - maybe "things that are names of animals"? LARK, DUCK, RAM - only 3.

OUTFIT, READY, WILLING, ABLE, PREPARE, DOWN, EAGER, NASA, NOAA, EAVE, N.F.L., PARAMOUNT, SUBARU, EQUIP, CANE

1. <b>Organizations/Agencies (acronyms):</b> NASA, NOAA, N.F.L. - all are US organizations
2. <b>Preparation/readiness words:</b> READY, WILLING, ABLE, PREPARE, EAGER, EQUIP
3. <b>Brands:</b> PARAMOUNT (pictures), SUBARU (cars)
4. <b>Things that can be "gotten":</b> Can you get or have an OUTFIT, CANE, GAME?

Looking more carefully at "PREPARE" - could be related to "READY", "WILLING", "ABLE", "EAGER" - all indicate a state of readiness or willingness.

Actually, I notice something interesting: NASA and NOAA are both US government agencies. They're both related to atmospheric/environmental science. And N.F.L. is also American. 

But wait - I'm seeing another pattern. What if I look at words that can follow certain common words? Or maybe there's something with how they can be used in phrases?

Actually, let me reconsider: I notice that ABLE, EAGER, READY, WILLING, PREPARED (similar to PREPARE), EQUIP(ped) all share something - they're all adjectives or states of being that describe readiness/willingness.

Actually, I think I should try to find 4 words that clearly belong together. Let me try looking at the agency/acronym angle: NASA, NOAA, N.F.L. - these are three. What could be the fourth? Perhaps something like "FBI" or "CIA" - but those aren't in the list.

Hmm, what about looking at things that can follow "PANDA" or some other common word? No...

Let me try a different approach - what about synonyms? EAGER and WILLING are very similar in meaning. READY is similar too.

&bull; BE READY ✓
&bull; BE WILLING ✓
&bull; BE ABLE ✓
&bull; BE EAGER ✓
&bull; BE DOWN? (be down = be interested/down for something)
&bull; BE GAME (be game = be willing to try)

That's interesting! READY, WILLING, ABLE, EAGER, GAME all relate to being willing or prepared to do something. This could be a category!

Actually, there's also:
&bull; BE PARAMOUNT (be most important)
&bull; BE SUBARU? No

Let me try this set of words related to willingness/agreement:</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

6. <b>"Awkward" synonyms</b>: AWKWARD, STILTED, STIFF

Looking for exactly 4 words that fit together:

The strongest category I see is the <b>wood-related</b> group. We have:
&bull; WOOD
&bull; WOODY (related to wood)
&bull; WOODEN (made of wood)
&bull; WOODCHUCK (animal whose name contains "wood")

That's exactly 4 words that clearly belong to a "Wood" category. The other wood-related word WOODSTOCK could be debated (it's a place name, not literally wood), so I'll exclude it to be safe.

This gives me a solid category of 4 wood-related words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

1. <b>Peanuts/Charlie Brown connection</b>: 
   - CHUCK (Charlie Brown's first name)
   - WOODSTOCK (the bird in Peanuts)
   
2. <b>Word relationships</b>:
   - STILTED, AWKWARD, STIFF (synonyms - relating to something uncomfortable or not flowing naturally)
   - FOGHORN (a type of sound/horn)
   
3. <b>"Could" + word</b>: Could is a modal verb

Let me think about the "wood" words again:
&bull; WOOD, WOODEN, WOODY, WOODCHUCK, WOODSTOCK

Wait - maybe I was on the right track but need to reconsider WHICH wood-related words. Let me think about compound words or phrases:
&bull; WOOD + CHUCK = WOODCHUCK
&bull; What about "CREATE" + "COULD" = ?

Actually, let me think about words that can go BEFORE another word:
&bull; WOOD (can go before CHUCK, STOCK, etc.)
&bull; CREATE (can go before... nothing obvious)
&bull; COULD (modal verb)

Let me try a different approach. What about <b>words that describe something stiff/awkward</b>:
AWKWARD, STILTED, STIFF - these are 3 synonyms!

Let me see if there are any other words that could fit this category or find a different group of 4.

Actually, let me try the <b>sound</b> category:
FOGHORN, AWKWARD (sounds awkward?), STILTED (sounds stilted?), STIFF?

No, that's forced.

Let me try another approach: <b>Compound words or word + suffix/prefix</b>:
&bull; WOOD + CHUCK = WOODCHUCK
&bull; WOOD + EN = WOODEN
&bull; WOOD + Y = WOODY

That's 3. What about CREATE + ? Or COULD + ?

Wait - what about "CREATE" as in create something, and "WOOD" as a material you create with?

I think the most logical answer is still the wood-related group. Let me try a slightly different combination or consider that maybe one of my original 4 doesn't belong and there's another wood word.

Actually, wait - what if the answer is <b>words that come from WOOD</b> or relate to it more broadly? Let me try: WOOD, WOODEN, WOODY, WOODSTOCK (which is named after wood)</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Actually, I notice I haven't tried the <b>stiff/stilted/awkward</b> synonyms yet:
&bull; AWKWARD
&bull; STILTED

That's 3, but I need 4. What about FOGHORN? Not really a synonym...

Wait - what about <b>words related to compound words with "wood"</b>:
&bull; WOODCHUCK = WOOD + CHUCK
&bull; WOODSTOCK = WOOD + STOCK

So CHUCK and STOCK are both words that can combine with "WOOD"!

Let me try: CHUCK, STOCK, WOOD, WOODSTOCK - but wait, STOCK isn't in the list!

Let me try: WOOD, WOODCHUCK, CHUCK, WOODSTOCK

Actually, wait - what about "CREATE" and "COULD" - they both relate to "making" or "ability"? No, that's weak.

Let me think about words that come from WOOD + something:
&bull; WOOD + CHUCK = WOODCHUCK
&bull; WOOD + EN = WOODEN
&bull; WOOD + Y = WOODY

All three use "WOOD" as a base! And we have all these in our word list. But wait, I already tried this combo. Maybe one of these doesn't actually belong?

3. <b>Photo editing</b>: PHOTOSHOP, AIRBRUSH, TOUCH UP - all related to photo editing/retouching.

4. <b>Technology/software</b>: SOLAR PANEL, PHOTOSHOP, SPREADSHEET.

5. <b>Single words that could pair</b>: PAIN, FIX, ANGEL, ORGANISM - these don't fit obvious categories yet.

Let me reconsider the French connection more carefully. All three food terms are indeed French words. This seems like a strong category. What else could be French among the remaining words? Let me check...

Actually, looking more closely at my categories:
&bull; French food terms: CORNICHON, PAMPLEMOUSSE, VINAIGRETTE (3 words)
&bull; Christmas decorations: CANDY CANE, TINSEL, STRING LIGHTS (3 words)  
&bull; Photo editing: PHOTOSHOP, AIRBRUSH, TOUCH UP (3 words)

Each category only has 3 words, but I need 4. Let me think about which category is most likely correct.

The French food terms seem very intentional - these are uncommon English words that are specifically French. This feels like a deliberate puzzle design choice.

For Christmas decorations - CANDY CANE and TINSEL are very specifically Christmas, but STRING LIGHTS could be for any holiday or general use.

For photo editing - these are all clearly related to the same domain.

I'll go with the French words since they share the specific characteristic of being French loanwords used in English cooking.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Looking at what I tried: French food terms (CORNICHON, PAMPLEMOUSSE, VINAIGRETTE) - but I incorrectly added HONEYCOMB which doesn't fit that category.

Let me look for other potential groupings:

1. <b>Christmas items</b>: CANDY CANE, TINSEL, STRING LIGHTS (3 words) - I could try adding a fourth Christmas item

2. <b>Photo editing software/actions</b>: PHOTOSHOP, AIRBRUSH, TOUCH UP (3 words)

3. <b>Technology/Tools</b>: SOLAR PANEL, PHOTOSHOP, SPREADSHEET - these are all software/programs

4. <b>Single word items</b>: PAIN, FIX, ANGEL, ORGANISM - these don't seem to fit

Wait - maybe the category is PHOTO-RELATED? Let me think:
&bull; PHOTOSHOP (software)
&bull; AIRBRUSH (tool technique used in photos)
&bull; TOUCH UP (photo editing action)
&bull; Maybe something else...

Actually, let me try the Christmas category since those three seem very clearly connected:
CANDY CANE, TINSEL, STRING LIGHTS - all Christmas decorations

What fourth word could fit? None of the remaining words are clearly Christmas-related though.

Let me try a different approach - what about words that have multiple meanings or wordplay:
&bull; SPREADSHEET (Excel)
&bull; PHOTOSHOP (software)
&bull; SOLAR PANEL (technology)
&bull; AIRBRUSH (tool)

These are all tools/software. Let me try this category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

   - LORDE (noble title OR singer name)
   - BIRD (animal OR slang for girl OR surname)
   - MOTHER (parent OR religious figure "Mother" as a title)

Wait, there's another possibility - maybe I should look at categories based on what these words represent. 

Let me try: CLERGY MEMBER, POPE, BISHOP, SAINT PATRICK - these are all religious figures/positions in Christianity. Though mixing "saint" (a canonized person) with "clergy member" (a role) and "pope/bishop" (positions) is slightly mixed.

Actually, let me reconsider - perhaps I should group:
CLERGY MEMBER, POPE, BISHOP - these are all Christian religious LEADERS/TITLES

And SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE are both SAINTS - named saints specifically.

So I could do: POPE, BISHOP, CLERGY MEMBER, (need one more) - but that doesn't quite work.

Let me try another approach - perhaps they're looking for words that can precede or follow certain words, or have multiple meanings. 

I'm exploring potential connections between words with multiple interpretations. Some words like BURNS, LORDE, BIRD, and MOTHER have interesting semantic variations that might create a unique grouping. These words can&lt;guess&gt;
BURNS, LORDE, BIRD, MOTHER&lt;/guess&gt;

&bull; SAINT PATRICK → St. Patrick's Day
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE → Valentine's Day  
&bull; BURNS → Burns Night (celebration of poet Robert Burns)
&bull; PRESIDENT → Presidents' Day

Let me try another approach. Looking at the previous incorrect guess of BURNS, LORDE, BIRD, MOTHER - these were all words that could be used as nicknames/names for people:
&bull; BIRD (nickname like "Bird" for Larkin)
&bull; LORDE (stage name or title)
&bull; BURNS (surname - Robert Burns)
&bull; MOTHER (as a name/title)

Now let me try the religious leaders group: POPE, BISHOP, CLERGY MEMBER are all religious titles/positions. SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE are saints. These could potentially form a category.

But wait - I should look for exactly 4 words. Let me try POPE, BISHOP, CLERGY MEMBER, and... what fits? SAINT PATRICK is a saint, not a religious title/position in the same way.

Actually, I wonder about another grouping. Let me think about words that could follow "bird" or be associated in another way. 

Let me try: N.F.L. PLAYER, M.L.B. PLAYER, PRESIDENT, BIRD - all could have nicknames? No...

Let me try the religious figures: POPE, BISHOP, CLERGY MEMBER, (need one more)
Or SAINT PATRICK, SAINT VALENTINE, and two others...

Wait - what about words that can come AFTER "Saint"? SAINT PATRICK and SAINT VALENTINE are two, but what about the others?

&bull; BIRD could refer to the Baltimore Ravens (NFL) or Baltimore Orioles (MLB)
&bull; N.F.L. PLAYER could be on a team called "Birds"
&bull; M.L.B. PLAYER could similarly be on a bird-named team

But that seems too indirect.

Let me think about this differently. What about "names that can follow 'Saint'"?
&bull; SAINT PATRICK
&bull; SAINT VALENTINE

But that's only 2...

What about titles that can follow a name? Like "Mother" Teresa, "President" (as a title), "Bishop" (as a title), "Pope" (as a title), "Lord" (like Lorde)...

Wait! LORDE - the singer uses "Lord" as her stage name. And PRESIDENT is a title. BISHOP is a title. POPE is a title. These are all TITLES that can be used as names or titles!

2. Entertainment/Performance: ARIA, ENCORE, CROSSWORD, DOMINO 
3. Words with repeating letters: ARS, AREA, EASE, AYES, OWES, ORCA
4. Things related to Egypt: LUXOR (Egyptian city), ORCA (no), EXCALIBUR (no)

The most coherent category I see is MATHEMATICAL MEASUREMENTS: AREA, VOLUME, PERIMETER, and LENGTH. These are all fundamental geometric terms used to measure different aspects of shapes and objects.

Let me verify:
&bull; AREA = measurement of a surface
&bull; VOLUME = measurement of space
&bull; PERIMETER = measurement around a shape
&bull; LENGTH = measurement of size in one dimension

Now I need to find another category from the remaining words:

Let me look for another grouping:

1. Entertainment/Performance: ARIA (operatic solo), ENCORE (performance), CROSSWORD (puzzle game), DOMINO (game)
2. Words with repeated letters: ARS, EASE, AYES, OWES, ORCA, OREO
3. Places: LUXOR (Egyptian city)
4. Legendary items: EXCALIBUR (sword)

Let me think about a strong category... 

ARIA and ENCORE are both performance-related terms. But I need 4 words.

What about words that can be preceded by "BLACK"? Let me think... BLACK + ARIA = no... BLACK + OREO = no...

What about words that rhyme or have similar endings? Not seeing it.

Let me try the PERFORMANCE/ENTERTAINMENT category: ARIA, ENCORE, CROSSWORD, DOMINO
&bull; ARIA = operatic solo
&bull; ENCORE = extra performance 
&bull; CROSSWORD = word puzzle
&bull; DOMINO = tile game

These are all forms of entertainment or performance. This seems like a reasonable category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me analyze the remaining words more carefully:
ARS, DOMINO, EXCALIBUR, CROSSWORD, OREO, EASE, ENCORE, ARIA, AYES, OWES, ORCA, LUXOR

Let me think about words with special patterns:

1. Words with repeated letters:
&bull; EASE (has two E's)
&bull; AYES (has A and E)
&bull; OWES (has O and E)
&bull; ORCA (has O and A)
&bull; OREO (has two O's)
&bull; ARS (no repeat)

These could be a category - words containing exactly two unique letters. Let me check:
&bull; EASE: E, A, S (3 unique letters) - no
&bull; AYES: A, Y, E, S (4 unique letters) - no  
&bull; OWES: O, W, E, S (4 unique letters) - no
&bull; ORCA: O, R, C, A (4 unique letters) - no
&bull; OREO: O, R, E (3 unique letters) - no

Actually, what about words that start and end with the same letter?
&bull; ARS (starts with A, ends with S) - no
&bull; AREA (not available) - yes
&bull; OREO (starts with O, ends with O) - YES!

Wait, that's not it. Let me think of another approach.

What about a category of words that are all types of games or things you can play?
&bull; DOMINO (game)
&bull; CROSSWORD (puzzle)
&bull; OREO (not a game)
&bull; ARIA (not a game)

What about something with the word "WHITE" or "BLACK"?
&bull; WHITE + OREO = no
&bull; BLACK + OREO = no

Let me try: words that can come after "STRONG" or similar?
&bull; STRONG + OREO = no
&bull; ARIA = no

Let me try another angle. What about words that can be prefixed with "PANDA"? No.

Wait - let me think about words that are homophones or sound-related. No.

Let me go back to the repeated letters idea but look at it differently - maybe all words that have double letters or repeated patterns:
&bull; OREO (OO)
&bull; EASE (EE)
&bull; Are there others?

This seems weak. Let me try something else.

How about words that could be preceded by "THE":
&bull; THE + OREO = no
&bull; THE + ARIA = yes (the aria)
&bull; THE + ENCORE = yes
&bull; THE + LUXOR = yes

That's 3 words, need 4.

What about ENGLISH/communication words:
&bull; CROSSWORD (puzzle)
&bull; ARIA (song)
&bull; ENCORE (performance)
&bull; Not quite

Let me try looking at the "AY/ES" sound words: AYES, OWES - these both end in the "z" sound. 

I see a pattern emerging with these two words - AYES and OWES share a similar phonetic ending. They both end with the "z" sound, creating an interesting linguistic connection. This sound-based similarity might be a&lt;guess&gt;
AYES, OWES, EASE, ORCA&lt;/guess&gt;

1. Words that can follow "LITTLE" or similar:
&bull; LITTLE + ARIA = no
&bull; LITTLE + OREO = no
&bull; LITTLE + LUXOR = no

2. Words related to music/entertainment: ARIA, ENCORE, CROSSWORD, DOMINO - I tried this

3. Words with double letters or repeated patterns:

&bull; EASE (EE)
&bull; Are there others?

Wait - let me think about what can follow "RED" or "WHITE":
&bull; RED + OREO = no
&bull; WHITE + OREO = no

What about things in a CASINO:
&bull; DOMINO (tiles)
&bull; Not sure about others

Let me try something different. What about words that are also names:
&bull; ARIA (name)
&bull; LUXOR (place)
&bull; ORCA (not typically a name)
&bull; OREO (not a name)

Hmm, let me think about what category I haven't tried yet. What about things you can DO with something:
&bull; AYES and OWES both relate to voting/money
&bull; ARIA and ENCORE both relate to performance

What about words that can come after "SINGING":
&bull; SINGING + ARIA = yes (singing aria)

Let me try a different approach. What about "things in a PACKAGE":
&bull; DOMINO (tiles come in boxes)
&bull; CROSSWORD (puzzle books)
&bull; OREO (package)
&bull; Not making sense...

Let me try looking at what these words could be in a different language or wordplay context. Let me try: things that have an alternate meaning when you change one letter?

Actually, let me try: things you can FIND in a LIBRARY:
&bull; CROSSWORD (puzzles)
&bull; AREA (not)
&bull; OREO (not)

I'm struggling. Let me try a final approach: what about words that can follow "DANCE":
&bull; DANCE + ARIA = no
&bull; DANCE + OREO = no

Let me go with something involving repeated letter patterns or common word beginnings/endings.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

&bull; EXCALIBUR (legendary sword)

&bull; OREO (sounds like "oh-ree-oh")
&bull; No...

&bull; LUXOR - yes
&bull; OREO - no

What about legal/official documents: DEED, TOKEN (as in token of document?), BIRTH (birth certificate?), maybe QUALITY? No...

Let me try the accommodation category again. Could CRUISE work as a type of accommodation (cruise ship)? That's a stretch, but it's worth trying. Or perhaps PLANT (as in "power plant" or "greenhouse" - a type of structure).

No, that didn't work.

Let me try another approach. What about categories like:

Let me identify potential categories:
1. Synonyms: DONE/COMPLETE are clear synonyms
2. Animals: SNAIL and SLUG are both gastropods
3. Racing terms: LAP (track lap), BULL (bull riding), SHOT (shot put)
4. Food: EGG, HARD TACO, M&amp;M, GULP (action with food/drink)
5. Prepositions: OVER, UNDER, THROUGH

Looking at the groupings more carefully:
&bull; DONE, COMPLETE could indicate completion/finishing
&bull; SNAIL, SLUG - both slow-moving creatures
&bull; BELT, LAP - could be clothing items or body-related
&bull; OVER, UNDER, THROUGH - prepositions indicating position/direction

My best guess would be SNAIL and SLUG as they are clearly related gastropods. Let me also consider DONE and COMPLETE as synonyms. But I need exactly 4 words.

Actually, the strongest connection seems to be SNAIL and SLUG. I need two more that fit with them - both are:
&bull; Slow movers
&bull; Garden creatures

Looking at the words again:

&bull; What about words related to food/eating? GULP, EGG, HARD TACO, M&amp;M
&bull; Racing terms: LAP (racing track), BULL (bull riding), SHOT (starting shot)

Let me try a preposition-focused approach. OVER, UNDER, and THROUGH are all prepositions or can function as prepositions. Let me see if there's a fourth word that fits:
&bull; DONE - no
&bull; COMPLETE - no  
&bull; WATCH - no
&bull; BELT - no

Actually wait - what about words that can follow these prepositions?
&bull; OVER: done, finished, there

Hmm, not quite working. Let me try thinking about words that go with "GO" - GO OVER, GO UNDER, GO THROUGH, GO... LAP? No.

What about synonyms or related concepts? Let me try a different approach - maybe these are words that rhyme or have similar sounds?

Looking at the words again:

Wait - I've been missing something obvious. What about words that can follow the word "COOKIE"? Or words related to stages of cooking?

Actually, let me think about this differently. What words have multiple meanings or can be used in multiple ways?

Let me try thinking about words that can follow the word "SOFT":
&bull; SOFT LAP? No
&bull; SOFT BELT? No
&bull; SOFT SHOT? No
&bull; SOFT OVER? No

What about words that can follow "HARD":
&bull; HARD... EGG? Yes (hard-boiled egg!)

&bull; HARD... BELT? No
&bull; HARD... SHOT? Yes (in photography)

Wait! EGG and HARD TACO both relate to cooking/eating! Let me think about what else fits...

SNAIL and SLUG are:

&bull; Both are slow-moving

&bull; MAIN, KEY - both can mean important/essential
&bull; SCALE, COMPASS - both relate to range/measurement
&bull; WALL, INSET - both relate to structural elements

Let me try BEAT, DOWNING, KEY, and MAIN as all relating to importance or defeating:
&bull; BEAT and DOWNING both relate to overcoming/defeating
&bull; KEY and MAIN both mean important

Actually, wait - let me reconsider. BEAT and DOWNING could relate to "knocking down" or defeating. KEY and MAIN both mean important. But this doesn't feel like a strong category.

Let me try: COMPASS, SCALE, FLEET, WALL
&bull; These don't seem to connect well

Let me try a different approach - words related to importance/priority:
KEY, MAIN, TOP, BEST - wait I already tried this.

What about: FLEET, BEAT, DOWNING, INSET
&bull; FLEET = group of ships
&bull; BEAT = nautical term for a sailing route

These are all MALE ANIMALS - specifically male versions of common farm/wild animals.

ZEST, SONG, STAG, SOLO, JACK, KICK, RAM, HAN, TANG, SINGLE, BILLY, FREE, MING, BUCK, ZING, PUNCH

Let me try a different approach - what words can pair with other words:

&bull; JACK: can be paired with KICK (jack kick - a dance move?), with BUCK (jack/buck both are male animals)
&bull; KICK: FREE KICK (soccer term)
&bull; SOLO: FREE SOLO (climbing style), SINGLE SOLO...
&bull; STAG: STAG PARTY, STAG NIGHT
&bull; BUCK: BUCK PARTY (similar to stag party)

Wait - STAG and BUCK could go with PARTY... but we don't have PARTY.

Let me try another angle: Words that are also names:
&bull; JACK - common name
&bull; BILLY - common name  
&bull; HAN - Chinese name
&bull; MING - Chinese name

But that's only 4...

Let me think about musical terms: SONG, SOLO - that's only 2.

What about words that rhyme or have similar endings? 

Wait - let me try: FREE, SINGLE, SOLO - all relate to "one" or "alone" - that's a category! But I need 4...

Actually, let me try the "male animal" group again differently or look for another grouping entirely. Let me try:
JACK (as in jackrabbit - but we don't have rabbit), RAM, BILLY, BUCK - all male animals... but that was rejected.

Hmm... Maybe I should try the "Chinese dynasty" pair: HAN, MING - but that's only 2.

Let me try: HAN, MING, TANG, ZING - wait, TANG is also a Chinese dynasty! And these all end in similar sounds! Let me try this.

Actually TANG is a Chinese dynasty, HAN is a Chinese dynasty, MING is a Chinese dynasty... and ZING is not a dynasty but has that sound...

No wait - there are also words that can follow "single": SINGLE, SOLO, FREE - no that doesn't work.

Let me try: SONG, SOLO, STAG, KICK - no.

I'll try: JACK, BILLY, BUCK, RAM - the male animals again but maybe in a different context.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me look for other categories:

1. Types of bags/luggage: DUFFEL, CARRY-ON, HARD-SHELL (these 3 clearly go together)
2. Names: INDIANA, FERRIS, HEATHER (3 names)
3. Small size words: PEE-WEE, BABY (2 words)
4. Vehicle-related: BUMPER, ROLLER, BUGGY (3 words)

The luggage category has 3 clear words. I need to find a 4th luggage-related word. Wait - could RUBBER be it? Like rubber bags? Not really...

Actually, thinking about it differently - could this be about things that are typically small in size? PEE-WEE and BABY both indicate small things. Let me look for other small-related words...

Wait - what about DUFFEL? A duffel bag is typically large, not small. CARRY-ON is also luggage.

Let me try names instead - INDIANA, FERRIS, HEATHER. These are all names. Let me see if there's a 4th name... None of the other words are clearly names.

Let me try a different approach - what about words that can come before "WHEEL"? ROLLER has wheel in it... not sure.

Let me go with the luggage category - maybe I'm missing something about RUBBER or another word.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

2. Small/tiny things: PEE-WEE, BABY - both indicate small size

3. Vehicle-related: BUMPER, ROLLER, BUGGY - all related to vehicles

Let me try the names category. INDIANA, FERRIS, HEATHER are definitely names. What could be a 4th? Maybe PEE-WEE (as a nickname) or BABY (as a term of endearment)?

Actually, FERRIS relates to Ferris wheel, and INDIANA relates to the state... Let me think if there's something else.

I have three clear luggage items: DUFFEL, CARRY-ON, HARD-SHELL. I need to find the 4th.

Looking at these words, I notice RUBBER could relate to luggage - like a rubber bag or something. But that seems weak.

Let me think about another possible category. What about things that have a specific number of wheels or something? Or maybe words that all relate to vehicles/transport?

Actually, wait - could all 4 be vehicle-related? Let me see:
&bull; BUMPER (car bumper)
&bull; ROLLER (roller skate, roller coaster)
&bull; BUGGY (baby buggy, horse buggy)
&bull; But CARRY-ON doesn't fit...

Let me go back to luggage. Maybe I'm missing something about one of the words...

Now I need to find another category among the remaining words.

Let me analyze what's left: AREAL, ARABESQUE, ANGULAR, AERIAL, ROUNDOFF, MERIDA, LINEAR, VOLUMETRIC, AURORA, ARIEL, SPLIT, TIANA

Looking for another group of 4:

1. <b>Disney Princesses</b>: MERIDA (Brave), TIANA (Princess and the Frog), ARIEL (Little Mermaid) - That's 3, need one more. There's no other Disney princess in the remaining words.

2. <b>Gymnastics terms</b>: ROUNDOFF, SPLIT - Only 2.

3. <b>Geometry/Measurement</b>: ANGULAR, LINEAR, VOLUMETRIC - That's 3.

4. <b>Words starting with "AR-"</b>: AREAL, AERIAL, ARABESQUE, ARIEL - These all start with "AR-" but don't seem to share a meaningful category.

Let me reconsider. Perhaps the geometric terms ANGULAR, LINEAR, and VOLUMETRIC could work with another word... or maybe there's a dance/movement category with ARABESQUE (a ballet position), ROUNDOFF, and SPLIT.

Actually, let me try the Disney Princesses + one more. Wait, I only have 3. Let me look for something else.

What about words related to shapes/forms? ANGULAR (has angles), LINEAR (lines), VOLUMETRIC (volume) - these are all geometric/measurement terms. I need one more... AREAL relates to area! That could work!

So: ANGULAR, LINEAR, VOLUMETRIC, AREAL - all relate to geometric concepts/measurements.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
ANGULAR, LINEAR, VOLUMETRIC, AREAL&lt;/guess&gt;

Looking for another group of 4:

1. <b>Disney Princesses</b>: MERIDA (Brave), TIANA (Princess and the Frog), ARIEL (Little Mermaid) - That's 3, but there's no other Disney princess in the remaining words.

2. <b>Gymnastics/Dance terms</b>:
&bull; ARABESQUE (a ballet position)
&bull; ROUNDOFF (a gymnastics move)
&bull; SPLIT (a gymnastics move)
&bull; AERIAL (could refer to an aerial gymnastics/dance move)

That's 4! ARABESQUE, ROUNDOFF, SPLIT, and AERIAL are all related to gymnastics, dance, or acrobatics. This seems like a solid category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Let me check what's left: MERIDA, AURORA, TIANA, and ARIEL

These are all Disney princesses/characters:
&bull; MERIDA from Brave
&bull; TIANA from The Princess and the Frog
&bull; ARIEL from The Little Mermaid
&bull; AURORA from Sleeping Beauty

This is a perfect category!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
