- Other possibilities spotted: Wax-related items (CANDLE, CRAYON, HONEYCOMB, SEAL for sealing wax); Swindle/cheat (FLEECE, HOSE as slang for cheat, ROB, STIFF as in not pay); Vegetable units (BULB as in onion, HEAD as in lettuce, EAR as in corn, STALK as in celery).

Strong category emerging: Units of vegetables or produce – BULB (as in garlic or onion), HEAD (as in lettuce or cabbage), EAR (as in corn), STALK (as in celery). This is a classic Connections-type grouping with precise, non-overlapping terms related to edible plant parts sold as units.

Other potentials like wax items (CANDLE, CRAYON, HONEYCOMB, SEAL) or ways to swindle (FLEECE, ROB, HOSE, STIFF) are viable but less immediately clear-cut; the produce connection feels most definitive and thematic for the puzzle's style.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Clear category: Ways to swindle or cheat someone – FLEECE (rip off), HOSE (slang for deceive), ROB (steal from), STIFF (not pay, e.g., stiff on a tip). These are idiomatic synonyms for defrauding, fitting Connections' style of slangy or colloquial groupings.

Wax-related items (CRAYON, CANDLE, HONEYCOMB, SEAL) is possible but weaker, as SEAL is a stretch (sealing wax) and less direct. The swindle connection is more cohesive and puzzle-appropriate.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I looked for potential categories by grouping words thematically:

- Music notation terms: QUARTER (quarter note), WHOLE (whole note), FLAT (flat symbol), NATURAL (natural symbol). This fits as elements of musical notation—durations and accidentals.

- ___ iron: PUMP (pump iron, weights), STEAM (steam iron), TIRE (tire iron), WAFFLE (waffle iron). This is a strong phrase-based category.

- Dog commands: DOWN, HEEL, SHAKE (shake paw), SPEAK (bark on command).

- Ways to express influence or opinion (have a ___): CHOICE, SAY (have a say), VOICE (have a voice), VOTE (have a vote).

These four groups cover all 16 words without overlap, confirming a complete puzzle solution. All categories are coherent and typical for Connections.

For my first guess, I'll start with the music notation group, as it's a direct terminology match with no idioms, making it a safe, high-confidence opener. If correct, it removes those words; if not, feedback will help refine.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now, grouping the rest:

- Dog commands: DOWN (command to lie down), HEEL (walk at heel), SPEAK (bark), SHAKE (shake hands/paw). This is a classic Connections category for pet instructions.

- Remaining after that: PUMP, TIRE, WAFFLE, STEAM – all can precede "iron" (pump iron for weights, tire iron tool, waffle iron appliance, steam iron appliance).

- Then: CHOICE, SAY, VOICE, VOTE – phrases like "have a say/voice/vote/choice" indicating influence or opinion.

These cover all words neatly. Dog commands is a strong, direct category, so I'll guess that next to confirm and proceed.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Grouping the rest: PUMP, TIRE, WAFFLE, STEAM all precede "iron" in common phrases – pump iron (lift weights), tire iron (tool for changing tires), waffle iron (kitchen appliance), steam iron (clothing appliance). This is a solid idiomatic category.

The final group would be CHOICE, SAY, VOICE, VOTE as in "have a ___" (have a choice/say/voice/vote), meaning ways to influence or express opinion.

I am analyzing potential categories by grouping words with clear connections.

One strong group emerges from scientific or physical processes related to changes in state of matter (phase transitions):
- MELT: solid to liquid.
- FREEZE: liquid to solid.
- VAPORIZE: liquid to gas (evaporation or boiling).
- CONDENSE: gas to liquid.

This fits perfectly as a category. No other words overlap here, and the connection is direct and thematic for Connections puzzles.

Other words suggest additional groups, such as:
- Substitutes/replacements: SUB, ALTERNATE, BACKUP, COVER.
- Slang for professions: SUIT (executive), HACK (journalist/taxi driver), COPPER (police officer), SHRINK (psychiatrist).
- Mariah Carey songs: FANTASY, HERO, HONEY, SOMEDAY.

Since this is the first guess, I'll start with the phase transitions group, as it's unambiguous and has no alternative interpretations. If correct, it will be removed, allowing progress on others.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- Slang for professions: SUIT (business executive), SHRINK (psychiatrist), HACK (journalist or cab driver), COPPER (police officer).

I see potential groups emerging. First, words related to nonsense or baloney: BUNK (as in nonsense), CROCK (as in "crock of nonsense"), HOGWASH (nonsense), HORSEFEATHERS (nonsense). This seems like a strong category for synonymous terms meaning "nonsense."

Other potential groups include: knots (BEND, BOWLINE, HITCH, SHEEPSHANK); track and field events/equipment (BATON for relay, HAMMER for throw, HURDLE for race, POLE for vault); and devilish features (GOATEE, HORNS, PITCHFORK, TAIL).

I see potential categories:
- Structural supports (vertical): PILLAR, COLUMN, POST, POLE. These are synonyms for upright supports in architecture or structures.
- Financial ownership terms: SHARE, STAKE, INTEREST, PERCENTAGE. These relate to portions of ownership or investment (e.g., stock share, stake in a company, interest rate, percentage ownership).
- Pay attention to: MIND, REGARD, OBSERVE, FOLLOW. These are synonyms meaning to watch, heed, or keep tabs on something.
- Confidential or insider information: INFORMATION, INTELLIGENCE, SECRETS, DIRT. These refer to knowledge, especially secretive or gossipy (dirt as scandalous info).

These four groups cover all 16 words without overlap, which is a strong sign of the correct Connections puzzle structure. For my first guess, I'll go with the structural supports group, as it's the most straightforward and visual connection with no ambiguity.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I identified four potential categories:

1. Camera brands: HASSELBLAD (Swedish medium-format cameras), OLYMPUS (Japanese cameras and lenses), POLAROID (instant cameras), FUJIFILM (Japanese film and cameras). This is a clear brand-based connection.

2. Sports stadium features: ASTROTURF (synthetic playing surface), JUMBOTRON (large video screen), SCOREBOARD (displays game info), SKYBOX (luxury seating). All common in arenas.

3. Adjectives from Italian cities: BOLOGNESE (from Bologna, as in sauce), NEAPOLITAN (from Naples, as in ice cream or pizza), PARMESAN (from Parma, as in cheese), VENETIAN (from Venice, as in blinds). These are eponyms tied to Italian places and associated products/styles.

4. Words containing rock band names: CREAMSICLE (CREAM), JOURNEYMAN (JOURNEY), KISSCAM (KISS), RUSHMORE (RUSH). Each embeds a classic rock band name sequentially.

These categories use all 16 words without overlap and fit Connections-style wordplay (brands, features, etymology, hidden words). The camera brands group is the most straightforward and literal, so I'll guess it first to confirm.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

These are all iconic elements found in sports venues, forming a cohesive group.

The other categories remain intact: Italian city eponyms (BOLOGNESE, NEAPOLITAN, PARMESAN, VENETIAN) and embedded rock bands (CREAMSICLE/CREAM, JOURNEYMAN/JOURNEY, KISSCAM/KISS, RUSHMORE/RUSH). Guessing the stadium features next as it's direct and thematic.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The leftover words (LODGE, WEDGE, STICK, PLANT) likely form a group meaning "to insert or embed," but confirming this Monopoly group first makes sense as it's cohesive.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- Small bits of wisdom or information: KERNEL (kernel of truth), NUGGET (nugget of wisdom), PEARL (pearl of wisdom), TIDBIT (tidbit of information). These are idiomatic expressions for small pieces of valuable insight, forming a clear linguistic category.
- Other possible groups include "Jurassic Park" elements (MOSQUITO, AMBER, DINOSAUR, PALEONTOLOGIST – mosquito in amber for dinosaur DNA extraction), slang for large sums of money after "make a" (BUNDLE, PILE, MINT, FORTUNE), and shades of purple (AMETHYST, EGGPLANT, LAVENDER, GRIMACE – referencing the purple McDonald's character/shake).

I'm analyzing potential categories. One strong connection emerges in technical issues common to video calls or online meetings: LAG (audio/video delay), FREEZE (screen or video freezing), DROP (dropped connection), and ECHO (audio feedback). These four words fit perfectly as a group of digital communication glitches, which is a typical Connections-style category involving modern tech problems.

Analyzing connections: A strong theme emerges with Disney's Aladdin characters. PRINCESS (Jasmine), GENIE (the Genie), MONKEY (Abu), PARROT (Iago). This fits as a cohesive group of key figures from the film, a common Connections category for pop culture references. Other words like MIME or SAMURAI don't fit this neatly, and no tighter alternative (e.g., costumes or mythology) overrides this. I'll guess this group next.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Strong connection in movie titles featuring numbers: APOLLO (Apollo 13), CANDLES (Sixteen Candles), FANTASTIC (Fantastic Four), SAMURAI (Seven Samurai). This fits a classic Connections category of films known by their numeric elements, similar to pop culture references like the prior Aladdin group.

Other potential groups like grassy areas (GROUNDS, GREEN, FIELD, LAWN) or Tarantino film title words (BROWN, FICTION, UNCHAINED, DOGS) are also viable, but the leadership group has the tightest, most direct connections, so I'll target that next.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Two clear categories remain. One is words from Quentin Tarantino movie titles: BROWN (Jackie Brown), DOGS (Reservoir Dogs), FICTION (Pulp Fiction), UNCHAINED (Django Unchained). This fits as a pop culture wordplay category, common in Connections, with direct, specific ties to one director's films. The other group (FIELD, GREEN, GROUNDS, LAWN) appears to be grassy expanses or areas. Both are strong, but the Tarantino connection feels more unique and thematic, so I'll prioritize that for this guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
