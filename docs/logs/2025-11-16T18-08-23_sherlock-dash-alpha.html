Look for clear categories of exactly 4 related words.

One strong group: Camera lens types. MACRO (macro lens), TELEPHOTO (telephoto lens), FISHEYE (fisheye lens), ZOOM (zoom lens). These are all standard photography lens categories.

Another potential: Contact/communication - EMAIL, CALL, ADDRESS (as in email address or speak to), NAME (as in name someone). But weaker.

Auction/eBay: EBAY, BID. Only 2, needs more - maybe PETITION (like bidding petition? No).

Legal: PETITION, APPEAL. Only 2.

Driver/NUMBER don't fit obviously yet.

Finlet/Flake seem odd; maybe fish parts or snow terms, but only 2.

The lens group is the tightest: MACRO, TELEPHOTO, FISHEYE, ZOOM. All precise matches for camera lenses.

Guess this first, as it's the most confident category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Next clear category: Ways to contact or reach someone - CALL, EMAIL, ADDRESS (as in "address someone" or email address), NAME (as in "name names" or call by name, but more precisely, all are ways to refer to or contact: call, email, address, name).

Stronger: Communication actions - CALL, EMAIL. But let's check auction first: EBAY, BID. What else? PETITION isn't auction. Maybe not.

Phone-related: CALL, NUMBER (phone number), DRIVER? No.

Another group emerging: Golf terms? DRIVER (golf club), but others no.

Snow types: FLAKE (snowflake). Only one.

Fish parts? FINLET (small fin), but FLAKE? Fish flake maybe, but weak.

Legal actions: PETITION, APPEAL - but APPEAL is gone? Wait, APPEAL was not in first guess. Wait, original had APPEAL, yes still there? Wait, original list: PETITION, ADDRESS, MACRO, APPEAL, TELEPHOTO, EBAY, BID, NUMBER, DRIVER, FISHEYE, FINLET, FLAKE, NAME, CALL, ZOOM, EMAIL.

First guess removed MACRO, TELEPHOTO, FISHEYE, ZOOM. So still: PETITION, ADDRESS, APPEAL, EBAY, BID, NUMBER, DRIVER, FINLET, FLAKE, NAME, CALL, EMAIL.

I missed APPEAL earlier. Yes, APPEAL is there.

So legal: PETITION, APPEAL. Still only 2.

Contact info: NAME, ADDRESS, NUMBER, EMAIL. Perfect! NAME (as in full name), ADDRESS, NUMBER (phone number), EMAIL. These are all standard pieces of contact information.

Yes, that's a classic category: Personal contact details.

That fits exactly 4: NAME, ADDRESS, NUMBER, EMAIL.

High confidence.

Others: EBAY, BID for auction, but need 2 more.

CALL could be phone call.

DRIVER might be golf or software.

PETITION, APPEAL legal.

FINLET, FLAKE ? Maybe cereal or fish.

But contact info is solid.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

(Removed previous: lenses and contact info)

Clear group: Auction actions/site - EBAY, BID. But need 4. CALL (as in "call a bid"?), but weak.

Legal terms: PETITION, APPEAL, CALL (call to court?), BID? No.

Another: Breakfast cereal mascots or types? FLAKE (corn flake), but FINLET no.

Fish features: FINLET (small fin), FLAKE (cod flake?), but weak.

DRIVER stands out - could be golf club.

CALL - phone call, but also "call" as in bid or appeal.

PETITION, APPEAL - both legal requests to higher authority.

Stronger group: Ways to request or seek favor - PETITION, APPEAL, BID (as in bid for contract), CALL (call for help)? But loose.

EBAY, BID - auction.

Perhaps synonyms for "request earnestly" or "plead": PETITION, APPEAL, CALL (call upon), BID (archaic for invite/offer).

But let's see golf: DRIVER is golf club, but others? No woods/irons here.

Another idea: Shark features? FINLET (some sharks have finlets), but flake?

Perhaps breakfast cereal: FLAKE (bran flake, corn flake), but others no.

CALL, BID, PETITION, APPEAL - all can mean "request".

- PETITION: formal request

- APPEAL: request for review/mercy

- BID: offer/request in auction

- CALL: request attention/action (e.g., "call to action")

But BID is stretch.

Looking closer: PETITION, APPEAL, BID, CALL.

Bid can mean "invite" or "command" in old language, but perhaps it's "formal requests": petition, appeal, call (summons), bid (tender).

This seems promising as a category like "pleas" or "formal asks".

Remaining: 8 words, so 2 groups left.

Another group: DRIVER, FINLET, FLAKE... what?

Finlet is a small fin on fish like tuna, flake could be fish flesh, driver? No.

Perhaps corn: FLAKE, DRIVER no.

I think the request group is good: PETITION, APPEAL, CALL, BID.

CALL as in "appeal" or "call on someone", BID as "make a bid/offer".

But confidence medium.

EBAY with BID, but only 2.

EBAY is the site for BIDding.

Perhaps CALL, BID are auction terms too (silent bid? No).

Auction related: BID, CALL (call the auction?), no.

Let's go with the legal/plea group: PETITION, APPEAL, BID, CALL.

Bid doesn't fit perfectly.

CALL (phone), but no phone left.

DRIVER - screw driver, golf driver, but no.

Perhaps the group is "snow___" or something, but no.

Flake (snowflake), but others no.

Another: Types of snow or fish terms, but let's decide.

Upon rethink: PETITION, APPEAL - both court terms.

To make a guess, the most connected 4 are PETITION, APPEAL, CALL, BID.

Call can be "court call", bid "bid in court"? No.

Perhaps communication left: CALL, but others.

CALL is left, and perhaps ADDRESS was used, but no.

I think auction/ecommerce: EBAY, BID, but only 2.

Perhaps "make a ___": make a BID, make a CALL, make a PETITION, make an APPEAL.

Yes! All phrases: make a bid, make a call (decision or phone), make a petition, make an appeal.

Perfect! Common phrase category: "MAKE A ___"

That fits exactly: BID, CALL, PETITION, APPEAL.

High confidence now.

Yes, "make a bid", "make a call", "make a petition", "make an appeal".

Spot on for Connections-style category.

Then remaining would be EBAY, DRIVER, FINLET, FLAKE - perhaps something else like "little ___" or brand things, but this guess first.

Great logic.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

(Last four remaining after three correct groups.)

These must be the final category. Need to identify the connection.

EBAY - auction site, anagram of "BYE A"? No.

DRIVER - golf club, software driver, chauffeur.

FINLET - small secondary fin on fish (e.g., tuna, sharks).

FLAKE - snowflake, cornflake, or fish fillet piece (cod flake).

Possible link: All can follow "little": little flake? No.

Perhaps breakfast cereal: Corn FLAKE, but EBAY no.

Shark Tank terms? EBAY no, but DRIVER? No.

Anagrams or wordplay? No.

Another: Golf terms? DRIVER yes, but FINLET no.

Fish: FINLET yes, FLAKE (flake of fish), but EBAY/DRIVER no.

Perhaps "Tony Hawk's Pro ___" games? Pro Skater, but no.

Company/product names? EBAY, but DRIVER no.

FLAKE as in Frosted Flakes mascot Tony, but no.

Perhaps they are all "web browser components" or something? No.

DRIVER as in printer driver, but no.

Let's search connections: Actually, upon thinking, EBAY, DRIVER, FINLET, FLAKE.

Perhaps "small versions": finlet (small fin), driver (screwdriver has small driver? No), flake (small piece), ebay mini? No.

Fish anatomy: finlet, but driver/flake/ebay no.

FLAKE can mean a small particle, finlet small fin.

Perhaps brand names or nicknames.

This is the last group, so whatever connects them is the category.

Possible: Words that can be preceded by "corn": cornflake, but corndriver? No.

Another idea: They all end with sounds or something.

EBAY sounds like "e-bay", no.

Perhaps "Shark features": sharks have dorsal FIN, pectoral fin, but FINLET (yes, some sharks like makos have finlets), but flake? Shark steak flaked? Weak. Ebay/Driver no.

Driver shark? No.

Perhaps it's "golf club types" but only driver, and finlet no.

Remaining are exactly these 4, so guess them all as the final group. In Connections, the last 4 always form a category, even if obscure.

But need to guess them. The category is likely something like "ending with sea creatures" or wordplay? Ebay ends with bay? No.

DRIVER, FLAKE - both can be types of screws or tools? Flake no.

Let's think differently: perhaps "cereal varieties": but only flake.

FINLET - rare word, specific to ichthyology.

Perhaps "Tony the Tiger's world" no.

Another: all can be verbs: flake (to flake out), driver (drive, but driver noun), bid no wait.

Since it's the last 4, and game requires guessing 4 related, just guess these 4.

Confidence high because no choice, but category unknown, but in logic, they must connect.

Upon deeper thought: EBAY (eBay), but perhaps "PayPal properties" no.

Perhaps "dandruff" flake, driver license for hair? No.

Perhaps the category is "mini or small versions": MACRO was lens, but no.

Finlet = little fin.

Flake = little bit.

Driver = little golf club? No, driver is long.

Ebay = ? 

Perhaps it's "words that can follow 'snow'": snowflake, but snowdriver? Snowfinlet no.

No.

Fish products: finlet no, flake yes (fish flake), driver no.

Perhaps it's "browser extensions" or tech: ebay has extension, driver software, macro was used, zoom used.

No.

Since it's Connections, likely wordplay or "seen in ___".

Perhaps "kinds of sharks": goblin shark has finlets? But driver shark? Flake shark? Ebay? No.

There's a "flake" as in dogfish flake, fish.

But let's look for common category.

Upon reasoning: perhaps they are all "4-letter words with F-L-A-K-E etc" no.

EBAY, but eBay is "online auction site", but others no.

Perhaps the category is "things with 'fin'": finlet has fin, but flake no.

Driver - finnish driver? No.

I think the connection is "little [something]": Little Flake (cereal?), no.

Perhaps "dolphin parts": dolphins have finlets? Some do, driver no.

To guess, since only 4 left, the guess is these 4, as they must be a group.

The response is to guess exactly these 4.

Yes, standard for last group.

Confidence 1.0 because it's the last ones.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Camera brands: FUJIFILM, POLAROID, OLYMPUS, HASSELBLAD. These are all well-known manufacturers of cameras and photography equipment. This seems like a strong, cohesive group of exactly four.

Stadium/arena features: SCOREBOARD, KISSCAM, JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX. These are all common elements found in sports venues (scoreboard for scores, kiss cam for audience interaction, jumbotron for large screens, skybox for luxury seating).

Ice cream flavors/names: NEAPOLITAN, CREAMSICLE. Only two, so not a full group.

Italian sauces/cheeses: PARMESAN, BOLOGNESE. Only two.

Italian-inspired adjectives: NEAPOLITAN, PARMESAN (Parmigiano-Reggiano), BOLOGNESE, VENETIAN. Possible, but weaker than camera brands.

Mountains: RUSHMORE (Mount Rushmore), but no others.

Miscellaneous: ASTROTURF (artificial grass), JOURNEYMAN (skilled worker), no clear group.

The camera brands form the tightest, most obvious category with no outliers. Stadium features are also strong and exactly four. Italian words are looser.

Remaining words: SCOREBOARD, NEAPOLITAN, ASTROTURF, PARMESAN, CREAMSICLE, KISSCAM, JOURNEYMAN, BOLOGNESE, VENETIAN, SKYBOX, JUMBOTRON, RUSHMORE.

Strongest remaining group: Stadium/arena features. SCOREBOARD (displays scores), KISSCAM (audience interaction camera), JUMBOTRON (large video screen), SKYBOX (luxury seating). These are all iconic elements found in sports stadiums and arenas. Perfect fit of exactly four.

Other potentials: Italian food terms (NEAPOLITAN, PARMESAN, BOLOGNESE, VENETIAN) – Neapolitan (ice cream or from Naples), Parmesan (cheese), Bolognese (sauce), Venetian (from Venice). Possible, but "Venetian" is more architectural/adjectival than food. Ice cream (NEAPOLITAN, CREAMSICLE) only two. ASTROTURF is stadium-related but artificial turf, not as core a feature as the others.

Remaining words: SCOREBOARD, NEAPOLITAN, ASTROTURF, PARMESAN, CREAMSICLE, KISSCAM, JOURNEYMAN, BOLOGNESE, VENETIAN, SKYBOX, JUMBOTRON, RUSHMORE.

Stadium guess failed, so perhaps it's SCOREBOARD, JUMBOTRON, ASTROTURF, SKYBOX – but ASTROTURF fits as stadium surface, though kiss cam/jumbotron are more display-focused.

Stronger group: Italian-inspired foods/sauces/names. NEAPOLITAN (ice cream from Naples), PARMESAN (Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese), BOLOGNESE (meat sauce from Bologna), VENETIAN (could link to Venetian dressing or cuisine, but looser). Actually, better: Italian city/region adjectives used in food: NEAPOLITAN, PARMESAN (Parmigiano), BOLOGNESE, and perhaps another? Venetian isn't standard food.

Ice cream: NEAPOLITAN, CREAMSICLE – only two.

Look for another: RUSHMORE stands out – Mount Rushmore. Perhaps presidents' faces or something, but no.

JOURNEYMAN – that's a term, perhaps band Journey? No.

Reconsider stadium: maybe it's SCOREBOARD, JUMBOTRON, KISSCAM – displays/cameras, but SKYBOX not.

Perhaps the stadium one is SCOREBOARD, ASTROTURF, JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX – all physical stadium features, excluding KISSCAM (which is an event/activity).

ASTROTURF is artificial turf used in stadiums, SCOREBOARD, JUMBOTRON (big screen), SKYBOX.

That might be it, as KISSCAM is more of a feature but perhaps not "infrastructure."

Italian foods seem promising: NEAPOLITAN, PARMESAN, BOLOGNESE... what's fourth? CREAMSICLE no.

PARMESAN, BOLOGNESE are sauces/cheeses, NEAPOLITAN ice cream, VENETIAN blinds? No.

VENETIAN is a blind type, but no.

Another idea: Ice cream flavors/brands: NEAPOLITAN, CREAMSICLE, and ? No.

Perhaps food named after places: NEAPOLITAN, BOLOGNESE, PARMESAN, and ? Venetian not really.

Parmesan is from Parma, Bolognese from Bologna, Neapolitan from Naples, Venetian from Venice – all Italian city adjectives used in food contexts (Venetian cookies or something, but it's a stretch but possible for Connections).

Connections often has "words that can precede X" or place-named foods.

I think the Italian place-named foods is a solid group: NEAPOLITAN, BOLOGNESE, PARMESAN, VENETIAN.

Parmesan is "Parmigiano" from Parma, close enough, and Venetian has culinary uses.

But Venetian is weaker. Let's see if there's better.

RUSHMORE – Mount Rushmore. Perhaps "mount" something, but no.

JOURNEYMAN – journeyman is a craftsman.

Perhaps rock bands: JOURNEY, RUSH, but RUSHMORE isn't, and no.

Rushmore -&gt; Rush, Journey-man -&gt; Journey? Too stretchy.

Sticking with stadium infrastructure, excluding kiss cam: SCOREBOARD, JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX, ASTROTURF.

Yes, those are all fixed installations in stadiums: scoreboard, jumbotron screen, skybox seating, astroturf field.

Kiss cam is a programmed feature on the jumbotron, not a physical thing itself.

That explains why the previous guess failed – KISSCAM doesn't fit as neatly.

Confidence high on this regrouping.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Clear group emerging: Foods/sauces/ice cream named after Italian places: NEAPOLITAN (from Naples, ice cream), BOLOGNESE (from Bologna, sauce), PARMESAN (from Parma, cheese), VENETIAN (from Venice, e.g., Venetian dressing or cuisine links). This is a classic Connections category of "named after Italian cities/regions."

Other words: CREAMSICLE (orange ice cream treat), KISSCAM (stadium feature, but previous was infrastructure, not events), JOURNEYMAN (skilled tradesperson), RUSHMORE (Mount Rushmore).

The Italian foods fit perfectly as a cohesive category of four. High confidence.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

These must form the final group. Possible connections: CREAMSICLE (orange popsicle-like treat), KISSCAM ("kiss cam"), JOURNEYMAN (Journey + man? But Journey is a band), RUSHMORE (Rush + more? Rush is a band).

Stronger link: Rock bands with extra wordplay. JOURNEYMAN evokes JOURNEY (band), RUSHMORE evokes RUSH (band). But CREAMSICLE? Cream is a band (Eric Clapton). KISSCAM -&gt; Kiss is a band.

Yes! Classic Connections wordplay: Band names hidden or evoked: CREAM(sicle), KISS(cam), JOURNEY(man), RUSH(more).

Analyze for categories. Notice onomatopoeic sounds of disapproval: TSK, TUT, TUT TUT (Tut-tut is a common expression like tsk-tsk). These are verbal expressions of disapproval or scolding sounds. TSK is like "tsk tsk", TUT is similar, TUT TUT is explicitly the phrase. That's a strong group of 3, but need 4. SHAME could fit loosely as a verbal reprimand ("Shame!"), but let's see.

Other groups: Movie donkeys/animals? DONKEY KONG, DONKEY (from Shrek?), but not clear.

Doctors: DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle). FOLEY might be a stretch.

Kings: AKEEM (from Coming to America, "King" Akeem? Actually Prince but becomes king). TUT (King Tut). KONG? No.

Sounds: FLY, ZIP (zipper or fast movement). BARREL? No.

Snake-related: COBRA. No others.

Racing movies? RACE. No.

Disapproval sounds strongest: TSK, TUT, TUT TUT. What's the fourth? Perhaps "SHAME" as in calling out shame.

Upon second look, common interjections of disapproval: TSK, TUT, TUT-TUT, and often "TSK-TSK" is mirrored by these. But need exactly 4 words.

Actually, standard Connections often has "expressions of disapproval" like TSK, TUT, TUT-TUT, and maybe another. BAD? No.

FOLEY is sound effects, but not.

Perhaps animal sounds or something. DONKEY (hee-haw), KONG (ape), COBRA (hiss), no.

Dr. ___ : DOLITTLE. Is there Dr. CAKE? No. Dr. RACE? No.

Famous apes/monkeys: DONKEY KONG (video game ape), DONKEY (but donkey is not ape), KONG is King Kong. No.

DONKEY KONG is one, but DONKEY is part of it.

Perhaps movie titles with animals: COBRA? No.

Let's group by pop culture:

- DONKEY KONG

- DR. DOLITTLE (often just Dolittle)

- KING KONG (KONG)

- DR. AKEEM? No, Akeem is from Coming to America.

Coming to America has Prince Akeem.

King Tut = TUT.

Perhaps fictional kings: AKEEM (crowned king), TUT (King Tut), KONG (King Kong), and ? 

Who else? CAKE? Queen? No.

BARREL? No.

DONKEY KONG is "Donkey Kong", but Donkey is the character name, Kong is part.

Perhaps characters known for "talking to animals" or something. Dolittle.

Let's think of sounds of disapproval more carefully.

Searching my knowledge: Common Connections-style category for "chiding sounds" or "scolding interjections": TSK, TUT, TUT-TUT, and often "TCH" or something, but here we have TSK, TUT, TUT TUT.

What's the fourth? Perhaps "SHAME" as in "shame on you".

TSK, SHAME - but shame is not a sound.

Look at TSK, TUT, TUT TUT - that's 3, perhaps ZIP as in "zip it", but no.

Another idea: Sounds of impatience or disapproval: TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, and FLY? No.

Perhaps it's TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, and COBRA? No.

Let's try different grouping.

Notice CAKE, RACE, SHAME, BAD - those could be words that can follow "no such thing as a free ____" ? No.

BAD, SHAME, RACE? No.

Perhaps words that double: TUT TUT, DONKEY KONG? No.

DONKEY KONG, DR DOLITTLE, KING KONG, DR AKEEM? No.

Dr. Dolittle, and Akeem is not.

Let's think of movie characters or titles with animals.

Strong group: Donkey from Shrek, Kong from King Kong, Cobra from GI Joe or movie, but weak.

Another: FOLEY is sound artist, but no.

Perhaps barrel roll or something.

Let's try to find 4 that fit perfectly.

Look at TUT, TUT TUT, TSK - and perhaps "TSK" is "tsk tsk", so doubles.

Fourth could be "CAKE" ? No.

Perhaps the category is "disapproving noises": TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, and "BARREL"? No.

Upon reflection, I recall similar puzzles where the category is "mild rebukes" or "sounds of disapproval": tsk, tut, tut-tut, and often "shh" or something, but here SHAME might fit as "for shame".

But SHAME is a word said in disapproval.

Let's see if there's better.

Another group: ZIP, FLY, RACE, BARREL - words meaning "move quickly": zip, fly, race, barrel (barrel along).

That seems promising! ZIP (move fast), FLY (move fast), RACE (go fast), BARREL (barrel down the highway).

Yes, that's a solid category: "move quickly".

Confirm: zip along, fly by, race past, barrel through. Perfect.

Now, is there stronger? But confidence high on this.

Disapproval: still need 4th for TSK etc.

DONKEY, COBRA, KONG, DOLITTLE? Animal characters/doctors? Dolittle talks to animals, Donkey (Shrek), Cobra (snake character?), Kong (gorilla).

Weak.

AKEEM, DOLITTLE, KONG, DONKEY - movie titles/characters: Coming to America (Akeem), Dr. Dolittle, King Kong, Donkey from Shrek.

But Donkey is not a title.

Dr. Dolittle, Donkey Kong (game but has movies), King Kong, but Akeem no.

I think "move quickly" is the best first guess: FLY, ZIP, RACE, BARREL.

Yes, all verbs for fast movement.

Confidence high, as they fit perfectly without stretches.

Other potential: CAKE, BAD - bad cake? No.

SHAME, BAD - feelings.

FOLEY - sound for walking etc.

But go with speed words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Strong category emerging: Sounds/expressions of disapproval. TSK (tsk-tsk), TUT (tut-tut), TUT TUT (explicitly tut-tut), and SHAME (as in "shame on you!" or "for shame!", a verbal rebuke). These are all interjections or short phrases used to express disapproval or mild scolding. Fits perfectly as a Connections-style group for "chiding sounds" or "expressions of disapproval."

Confirm fit: TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, SHAME – all vocalized disapproval.

Other remainings: DONKEY, KONG (Donkey Kong), DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle), AKEEM (maybe Coming 2 America, but fits less). COBRA (G.I. Joe or snake), FOLEY (sound effects), CAKE, BAD.

Another potential: Animal movie stars/characters – DONKEY (Shrek), KONG (King Kong), DOLITTLE (talks to animals), COBRA? Weak.

Or fictional doctors: DOLITTLE (Dr.), but FOLEY? No.

Remaining: TSK, COBRA, SHAME, CAKE, FOLEY, BAD, AKEEM, TUT, DOLITTLE, KONG, TUT TUT, DONKEY.

Strong new group: Fictional doctors: DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle), AKEEM? No. Wait, better: DONKEY KONG (video game character), DR. DOLITTLE (often just "Dolittle"), KING KONG ("Kong"), and ? 

Actually, prominent pattern: DONKEY KONG, DR DOLITTLE, KING KONG – that's 3 using DONKEY, KONG, DOLITTLE. Fourth? Perhaps DR FOLEY? No.

Movie titles/characters missing first word: DONKEY [Kong], DR [Dolittle], KING [Kong? Wait Kong is used], no.

Notice DONKEY KONG, DR DOLITTLE – both "Dr." or character names? Donkey Kong isn't Dr.

Better group: Famous apes/gorillas or video game icons? KONG (King Kong/Donkey Kong), DONKEY (Donkey Kong), but donkey not ape.

Another: CAKE, SHAME, BAD – words that pair with "no": no cake? No. "Walk of SHAME", but no.

FOLEY – sound design, perhaps onomatopoeia with TSK, but previous wrong.

Regroup disapproval without SHAME: but need 4, only 3 sounds: TSK, TUT, TUT TUT. Maybe BAD as "bad boy!" or something, weak.

Look at names: AKEEM (Prince Akeem from Coming to America), DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle), DONKEY (Shrek), KONG (King Kong) – all famous movie characters with animal connections? Akeem no animals.

Dr. Dolittle (talks to animals), Donkey (Shrek animal), Kong (animal), Cobra (snake character from movies like G.I. Joe or Rambo).

COBRA, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, KONG – animal-related movie titles/characters: Cobra (snake), Donkey (animal), Dolittle (animals), Kong (gorilla). Decent, but "Cobra" is stretch as standalone movie is action, but fits "animal names in titles".

Perhaps the sounds are TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, and FOLEY? Foley is sound effects, not disapproval.

FOLEY is a type of sound, but no.

BAD CAKE? No.

SHAME, BAD, CAKE – ? No.

Another idea: "Doctor" precedes: but only DOLITTLE.

Let's think pop culture: DONKEY KONG (game/movie), DR. DOLITTLE (movie), KING KONG (movie), and perhaps BLACK PANTHER or no.

DONKEY, KONG, DOLITTLE – and the fourth is AKEEM? No.

Perhaps the category is characters played by Eddie Murphy: AKEEM (Coming to America), DONKEY (Shrek), DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle), and ? He voiced Donkey, played Dr. Dolittle, Akeem yes. What's fourth?

Eddie Murphy roles: Akeem, Donkey, Dolittle, and... he was in Doctor Dolittle, Shrek (Donkey), Coming to America (Akeem). Is there fourth here? Perhaps that's 3.

COBRA? No.

But close – is there a fourth Eddie Murphy role in the list? No.

FOLEY? No.

Perhaps it's DONKEY, DOLITTLE, AKEEM, KONG – but why?

Kong not Eddie.

Upon reflection, Eddie Murphy: Coming to America (Akeem), Dr. Dolittle (Dolittle), Shrek (Donkey), and The Nutty Professor? No.

But 3 is not 4.

Perhaps including "48 Hrs" no.

Another group: TSK, CAKE, FLY, but fly gone.

Remaining have CAKE, BAD – "piece of CAKE", "bad" .

Perhaps "The ____" movies or something.

Let's try to find 4 that fit tight.

Look at COBRA, KONG, DONKEY, DOLITTLE – wait, Donkey Kong, King Kong, Dr. Dolittle, and Cobra? Still weak.

Perhaps video game characters or something.

Stronger: notice "King" : KING KONG (KONG), KING TUT (TUT), and AKEEM becomes king in Coming to America, and ? Perhaps "King" COBRA.

King cobra (snake), King Kong, King Tut, King Akeem.

Yes! That's perfect – all can be preceded by "KING":

KING COBRA, KING KONG, KING TUT, KING AKEEM (he's crowned king).

AKEEM is specifically the character who becomes king, and it's often referred to that way. Fits Connections-style "words that precede 'king'" or no – "king ___".

No: KING COBRA, KING KONG, KING TUT, and KING AKEEM? King Akeem yes, from the movie.

TUT is King Tut, KONG is King Kong, COBRA is king cobra, AKEEM is king Akeem.

Perfect match! All famous "King [word]".

High confidence, as it's precise and no stretches. Previous disapproval wrong because those are separate.

Yes, go with that.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Speed correct, removed. Remaining: TSK, COBRA, SHAME, CAKE, FOLEY, BAD, AKEEM, TUT, DOLITTLE, KONG, TUT TUT, DONKEY.

Kings guess close but wrong—perhaps not AKEEM, or different combo. TUT likely King Tut, KONG King Kong, COBRA king cobra, but fourth not AKEEM. Maybe DONKEY no.

Eddie Murphy roles strong: AKEEM (Coming to America), DONKEY (Shrek voice), DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle lead). Need fourth. FOLEY? No. Eddie Murphy in "The Golden Child"? No match. Perhaps SHAME no. Actually, he also did "Doctor Dolittle," "Shrek" Donkey, "Coming to America" Akeem, and "Beverly Hills Cop" but no. Wait, is there "Norbit" no. Perhaps the fourth is CAKE? No.

FOLEY—Eddie Murphy not. Perhaps category is Eddie Murphy characters: AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE... and that's 3, need 4th.

Perhaps including "Professor Klump" no.

New group: TSK, TUT, TUT TUT—clearly sounds of disapproval/scolding (tsk-tsk, tut, tut-tut). Previous wrong because included SHAME. Fourth must be from remaining: perhaps BAD (as in "bad!" scolding a child).

BAD, TSK, TUT, TUT TUT—mild rebukes: "bad!", "tsk", "tut", "tut tut". Plausible, but SHAME was stronger before, yet wrong.

SHAME still there, but grouping failed.

Another: CAKE, SHAME, BAD, FOLEY? No.

FOLEY (sound effects), perhaps with sounds.

Movie titles: DONKEY KONG (recent movie), DR DOLITTLE (multiple movies), DONKEY (Shrek), no.

Perhaps "talking animals" movies: DOLITTLE (talks to them), DONKEY (talking donkey Shrek), KONG (in recent films talks somewhat? No), DONKEY KONG animated.

Weak.

CAKE, BARREL gone, no.

BAD, SHAME—negative words, with ? 

Perhaps "piece of ___": piece of CAKE, piece of SHAME? No. Walk of shame, piece of cake, barrel of laughs gone, bad apple no.

FOLEY, as in foley artist for CAKE walking sounds? No.

Regroup kings without AKEEM: COBRA, KONG, TUT, and ? No fourth king.

King Donkey? No.

Perhaps the Eddie Murphy is it, but need fourth. Upon check: Eddie Murphy also in "Boomerang" no. Wait, perhaps "Vampire in Brooklyn" no. List doesn't have fourth obvious.

DONKEY, DOLITTLE, AKEEM—3.

Perhaps add KONG? No.

Let's list potential categories:

1. Eddie Murphy characters: AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE. Need fourth—perhaps it's not.

Perhaps "Dr. ___" but only DOLITTLE.

Another idea: words that can be doubled: TUT TUT, DONKEY KONG? Donkey Kong is doubled name, but not. CAKE WALK no.

TSK (tsk-tsk), TUT (tut-tut), but Tut Tut is already, and ZIP gone.

The disapproval is TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, and TSK is tsk-tsk so doubles.

But need 4 distinct.

Perhaps the fourth is "FOLEY" ? No.

Let's try different: perhaps "The ____" bands or something no.

SHAME, CAKE, RACE gone, BAD—songs or something.

Perhaps guilt words: SHAME, BAD, ? No.

Better: notice CAKE, FOLEY— ? 

FOLEY is Dave Foley? Actor, but no.

Perhaps sound-alikes or homophones no.

Let's think movie doctors: only DOLITTLE.

Perhaps animal "doctors" no.

DONKEY, KONG, COBRA, DOLITTLE: all associated with animals in films/games: Donkey (animal), Kong (gorilla), Cobra (snake), Dolittle (animals).

But loose.

Perhaps the category is Eddie Murphy +1: but no.

Search knowledge: actually, Eddie Murphy starred in:

- Coming to America as Prince/ King Akeem

- Dr. Dolittle as Dr. Dolittle

- Shrek as Donkey

Is there a fourth in the list? No, but perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy movie characters" and the fourth is "AXEL" no.

Only 3.

Perhaps including "Rashawn" no.

Perhaps it's not that.

Let's try to find another tight group.

Look at CAKE, BAD, SHAME, FOLEY? What do they have?

No.

BAD CAKE? No.

Perhaps "fart" euphemisms or sound words: no.

FOLEY is the art of creating sound effects, often for movies, and TSK, TUT etc are sounds, but previous wrong.

Perhaps the group is onomatopoeia or interjections: TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, and perhaps ZIP gone.

Still 3.

Perhaps include "CAKE" no.

Another idea: "Tut tut" is disapproval, "tsk tsk", and "shame shame" or "bad bad", but no.

Perhaps the disapproval is TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, BAD.

Let's test that.

But earlier with SHAME wrong, so maybe BAD instead.

SHAME might be in another group.

Let's see leftover after other groups.

Perhaps movie apes/monkeys: KONG (King Kong), DONKEY KONG (DONKEY and KONG, but two words), no.

Donkey is donkey, not monkey.

Donkey Kong is the ape, Donkey is his name? No, Donkey Kong is the gorilla-like character, "Donkey" is part of name.

Weak.

Another: perhaps "barrel of monkeys" but barrel gone.

Let's prioritize.

Strongest now: the Eddie Murphy characters, but only 3. Wait, is there fourth? Wait, Eddie Murphy also played "Professor Sherman Klump" but no.

Perhaps "Vicki" no.

Perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy film roles": AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and... wait, he was in "Holy Man" no.

Perhaps it's 3, so not.

Let's look for other connections.

Notice: SHAME, CAKE, BAD, RACE—but race gone.

"piece of cake", "walk of shame", "bad apple" no, "rat race" gone.

"rat race" race gone.

Perhaps "dirty" : dirty shame? No.

Another: perhaps sound effects categories or terms: FOLEY, and TSK as click tongue sound, but.

Perhaps the group is FOLEY, DOLITTLE, DONKEY, KONG - ? No.

DOLITTLE, DONKEY, KONG, COBRA - titles that start with "Dr." or "King" or "Donkey" no.

Dr. Dolittle, Donkey Kong, King Kong, King Cobra - but King Cobra is not movie title like others.

But earlier guess was close but wrong because Akeem instead of cobra? No, I had cobra in kings.

The kings guess was AKEEM, COBRA, KONG, TUT - wrong.

Perhaps the king group is COBRA, DOLITTLE? No.

Dolittle not king.

Perhaps swap AKEEM for something.

Perhaps no.

Let's try to think what could be the groups.

Likely groups are:

1. Move quickly: done.

2. Sounds of disapproval: TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, and ? Since SHAME wrong, perhaps BAD ("bad dog!" as scold).

Yes, "bad!", "tsk!", "tut!", "tut-tut!" all verbal scolds to children or pets.

That fits Connections perfectly - "scolding words".

Previous wrong because SHAME is not sound-like, but BAD is short interjection.

Yes.

Alternative: perhaps TUT TUT is British for taxi, but no.

Confidence on that.

Is there better?

Another group jumping out: CAKE, DONKEY, KONG, BARREL - but barrel gone. Donkey Kong has barrel levels, cake? No.

CAKE is "let them eat cake", no.

SHAME, CAKE - "no shame in my game", no.

FOLEY - perhaps actors: Dave Foley from Kids in the Hall, but no.

Perhaps "rapper names" or something: Akeem the Egyptian Lover? But obscure.

No.

BAD (Michael Jackson song), no.

I think scolding interjections: BAD, TSK, TUT, TUT TUT.

Yes, logical next guess, as the sounds are obviously grouped, and previous miss was adding SHAME.

High confidence.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: TSK, COBRA, SHAME, CAKE, FOLEY, BAD, AKEEM, DOLITTLE, KONG, TUT TUT, DONKEY. (TUT used but still available? No, used in guess but since incorrect, all remain.)

TSK/TUT/TUT TUT clearly one group (disapproval sounds), but adding SHAME or BAD didn't work—so perhaps their group is different or fourth is CAKE/FOLEY/etc. With 1 mistake left, need high-confidence group.

Best fit now: Eddie Murphy characters/movies – AKEEM (Coming to America), DONKEY (Shrek), DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle). Still 3—need fourth. FOLEY? No. But perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy titles/roles" and fourth is SHAME? No.

Refine: actual Eddie Murphy films with animal themes? Dolittle, Shrek (Donkey), but Coming to America no animals.

Stronger pattern: DONKEY KONG, DR. DOLITTLE, KING KONG – that's DONKEY, KONG, DOLITTLE. Need fourth for "titles missing first words" or similar.

Common Connections: "famous titles minus first word": DONKEY [Kong], DR [Dolittle], KING [Kong] – but Kong repeated.

DONKEY KONG uses DONKEY and KONG.

Perfect: the words complete these titles: DR DOLITTLE, DONKEY KONG, KING KONG... but what's fourth? KING COBRA? But Cobra not title.

King Kong uses KONG, Donkey Kong uses DONKEY and KONG, redundant.

Perhaps the group is DONKEY, DOLITTLE, FOLEY, KONG? Why Foley?

FOLEY – wait, perhaps not.

New insight: FOLEY is from "A Bug's Life" or actor, but no.

CAKE – "Layer Cake" movie, no.

SHAME – "There Will Be Blood" no.

Perhaps the sounds group fourth is FOLEY – as foley sounds include tsk-like, but weak.

With 1 left, go for the obvious remaining tight group.

Obvious now: Eddie Murphy roles – but to make 4, perhaps AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and... wait, is there "Kong"? No.

Upon precise recall: Eddie Murphy starred in Dr. Dolittle (1998), voiced DONKEY in Shrek, Prince AKEEM in Coming to America, and... the fourth could be considered "Rashidi" no.

Perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy characters": but let's confirm if there's a fourth in list.

No, only 3.

Perhaps it's DONKEY, DOLITTLE, AKEEM, SHAME? No.

Another idea: words that can be preceded by "Doctor": Doctor DOLITTLE, but Doctor BAD? No.

Let's list possible.

Perhaps CAKE, FOLEY, SHAME, BAD – what? No.

FOLEY (sound), TSK (sound), TUT TUT (sound), CAKE? No.

Perhaps the disapproval is TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, FOLEY – because foley artists create "tut tut" walking sounds or disapproval sounds? Weak.

Better: perhaps the group is movie sound categories or no.

Let's think differently. Perhaps "The ___" : the bad, no.

Perhaps donkey, cobra, kong, dolittle – "fictional animals".

Donkey (Shrek – talking donkey), Kong (King Kong – gorilla), Cobra (e.g., Cobra from G.I. Joe or Rambo's gun, but Cobra Commander is human; or king cobra but not fictional character primarily).

Dolittle is human.

Dolittle talks to animals.

Close but loose.

Perhaps the group is AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, KONG – all 90s/00s movie icons with sequels or something.

Weak.

Let's prioritize the most likely.

I think the Eddie Murphy is it, and the fourth is... wait, Eddie Murphy also played multiple roles in "The Nutty Professor", but no match.

Perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy movies, for short" or something.

To fit 4, perhaps it's AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and BAD? No.

Bad is not.

Perhaps it's not Eddie.

Let's try to search for connections between remaining.

Notice: CAKE, FOLEY – foley for cake squish sound? No.

Perhaps "pulp fiction" no.

Another: SHAME (film by Steve McQueen), no.

Perhaps "interjections": TSK, SHAME, TUT TUT, but previous wrong.

Since BAD didn't work with sounds, perhaps the sounds are only 3, and group is different.

With 1 guess left, need to pick the next strongest.

Strongest alternative: the "king" group but swap AKEEM for DONKEY? No.

King cobra, king kong, king tut, and king of the jungle or no.

King Tut (TUT), King Kong (KONG), King Cobra (COBRA), and King Donkey? No.

King Akeem was wrong.

Perhaps Tut Tut is separate.

Perhaps TUT TUT is not with sounds.

Tut Tut is the British scold or train sound.

Perhaps the group is animal doctors or no.

Let's try to see if there's a group with CAKE.

Piece of cake, barrel of laughs (barrel gone), can of worms no, walk of shame – "easy" or "types of walk": cake walk, walk of shame, but what else? Race walk gone, foley walk? No.

Cakewalk (easy), but word is CAKE.

Close but no.

Another: "no good" : bad, shame, but no.

Perhaps the group is FOLEY, CAKE, BARREL gone, no.

Foley, cake – no.

Let's consider pop culture again.

Dr. Dolittle – Rexxx the dog, but no.

Perhaps the group is DONKEY, KONG, DOLITTLE, AKEEM – all have live-action + animated movies or something.

Weak.

Perhaps it's characters known for voices or something.

Donkey (Eddie voice), Dolittle (Eddie), Akeem (Eddie), and Foley (Dave Foley voice actor in NewsRadio/Kids Hall, but also voices).

But stretch.

Perhaps the second group was wrong approach.

Since two guesses with TUT etc wrong, perhaps the sounds are TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, and SHAME is not, but BAD not, so fourth is COBRA? No.

Perhaps "tut tut" is disapproval, but perhaps category is "repeated words": TUT TUT, DONKEY KONG (kind of repeated style), no.

Donkey Kong, Tut Tut – doubled.

Tsk Tsk (TSK), Tut Tut.

But fourth?

ZIP ZIP gone.

Weak.

With 1 left, I need to risk the Eddie Murphy group, as it's the most specific connection in the list – 3 perfect matches can't be coincidence, perhaps the fourth is COBRA? No.

No, only 3.

Is there a fourth Eddie Murphy role in the list? Let's list all words again: TSK, COBRA, SHAME, CAKE, FOLEY, BAD, AKEEM, TUT, DOLITTLE, KONG, TUT TUT, DONKEY.

AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE – 3.

Perhaps including "Kong" as he was in "Kong: Skull Island" but no Eddie.

No.

Perhaps the group is DONKEY, KONG, DOLITTLE, FOLEY.

Why FOLEY? Upon thinking, is there Dr. Foley? No.

Perhaps FOLEY is from "Super Size Me" no.

New idea: perhaps "sound of disapproval" is TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, and "CAKE" ? No.

Perhaps the group is words that mean "nonsense" or "shush": tut tut meaning disapproval, but no.

Perhaps change tactic: perhaps the kings are COBRA, KONG, TUT, and DOLITTLE? No.

King cobra, king kong, king tut, and "king of beasts" no.

Perhaps it's COBRA, KONG, TUT, DONKEY – but why Donkey?

Donkey Kong is "donkey kong", but king? No.

Donkey Kong is not "king".

King Kong is separate from Donkey Kong, though same franchise now.

Perhaps the group is video game movies or something.

Donkey Kong has animated, Kong movies.

Weak.

Let's try to guess the Eddie Murphy one, as it's the standout connection, perhaps the fourth is KONG – but why?

No.

Perhaps it's AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and the fourth is "PLUMMER" no.

Perhaps it's not 4 Murphy, but Murphy-voiced or starred.

Eddie Murphy is the connection.

To make 4, perhaps BAD as "bad boys" but he was not in Bad Boys.

No.

Let's look up in mind: another Eddie Murphy animal movie? He did "Doctor Dolittle 2" with more animals, Shrek with Donkey, but Coming to America has no animal lead.

Perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy as animal doctor or animal friend" no.

Perhaps the group is different.

Let's try to find 4 other.

Another group: CAKE, SHAME, BAD, DONKEY – "ass" synonyms? Donkey is ass, bad ass, piece of cake no, shame your ass no.

No.

BAD, SHAME – "have no ___".

No.

Perhaps "Oscar winners" or no.

Perhaps FOLEY is the key.

What is FOLEY? In Connections, FOLEY is likely "foley artist" for movie sounds.

So perhaps sound-related: FOLEY, TSK, TUT TUT, and another sound word.

What other? CAKE? No.

COBRA (hiss sound), no.

Perhaps the group is "movie sound effects techniques" but only Foley.

No.

Perhaps "impersonated by Mike Myers" or no.

Let's think backwards: since speed was first, perhaps next is Eddie Murphy: AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and perhaps the fourth is KONG? No.

Perhaps it's AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, FOLEY.

Why FOLEY? Dave Foley was in "Blast from the Past" with Brendan Fraser, no.

Perhaps it's characters from 90s comedies.

Weak.

Perhaps the group is DONKEY, KONG, COBRA, AKEEM – no.

Let's see if there's a group with "fly" gone, but zipper fly, but no.

Remaining have ZIP gone.

Perhaps "snake" : cobra, bad apple no.

Perhaps the scolding is TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, SHAME – wrong, but perhaps order or something, but no, incorrect means not the group.

The feedback is INCORRECT, meaning those 4 not a category.

So different combo.

Perhaps the disapproval is TSK, SHAME, TUT TUT, FOLEY? No.

FOLEY sounds like "holy" or no.

Perhaps word play.

Perhaps "homophones for letters": TSK (tsks sounds like? No.

TUT (toot), no.

Perhaps "British" : tut tut, foley? No.

Let's try to pair.

Perhaps the group is CAKE, DONKEY, SHAME, ZIP gone – "let them eat cake", "wild donkey" no.

Perhaps I have it: the fourth for Eddie Murphy is "AKEEM", "DONKEY", "DOLITTLE", and "KONG".

Why Kong? Eddie Murphy was NOT in Kong.

No.

Perhaps it's movies with sequels numbered or something.

No.

Let's consider the remaining after assuming sounds are one group.

Suppose the sounds are TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, and the fourth is something we missed – but previous guesses with 4th wrong mean perhaps the category is "repeated interjections" but only those.

No, Connections is 4 words per group.

Perhaps the group is TSK, TUT, TUT TUT, KONG? No.

Perhaps leave the sounds for last.

Other possible group: BAD, CAKE, SHAME, ? What fourth? Perhaps "FOLEY" no.

"things that are 'easy'" : piece of CAKE, walk of SHAME? No, shame is not easy.

No.

"talk" : cake talk? No.

Another idea: "rapper monikers" : AKEEM (EPMD? No, Akeem the Egyptian Lover is rapper), BAD (bad boy? No), no.

Obscure.

Perhaps "King" is COBRA, KONG, TUT, and "DONKEY" no.

Why was the king guess wrong? Perhaps because AKEEM is not commonly "King Akeem" as standalone like the others.

So perhaps there's no fourth, or the group is COBRA, KONG, TUT, and something else.

What other "king" ? King Bad? No.

King Cake (Mardi Gras cake), king cake is a thing.

King cake – yes, the traditional Epiphany cake.

King cobra, king kong, king tut, king cake.

But the word is CAKE, not king cake primarily, but in Connections, "king ___" : king cobra, king kong, king tut, king cake.

Is king cake famous? Yes, it's a specific pastry.

But earlier kings with Akeem wrong, but perhaps replacing Akeem with CAKE.

Yes! That could be it – why not guessed before.

King cobra, King Kong, King Tut, king cake (the dessert).

Perfect fit, all "king [word]".

And Akeem was the stretch, that's why wrong.

Yes, high confidence now, as king cake is a real thing, and fits the pattern perfectly like the others.

Confirm: King cobra (snake), King Kong (film ape), King Tut (pharaoh), king cake (Twelfth Night pastry).

Yes, classic Connections "preceded by king".

Great, and explains why Akeem version was incorrect.

This must be it.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: TSK, SHAME, FOLEY, BAD, AKEEM, DOLITTLE, TUT TUT, DONKEY.

Now, clear group: Eddie Murphy roles – AKEEM (Coming to America), DONKEY (Shrek), DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle). Need fourth. With 8 left and 1 mistake allowed, but this is strong 3—wait, what's fourth?

Remaining: TSK, SHAME, FOLEY, BAD, TUT TUT.

FOLEY – Dave Foley? But no direct. Wait, perhaps the group is exactly AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE + ? 

Perhaps the fourth is FOLEY? No.

Shift: the disapproval sounds now clear: TSK, TUT TUT – but TUT gone. TUT was in king group, so TUT TUT is separate, TSK.

TSK, TUT TUT left for sounds.

Not 4.

Eddie Murphy is the standout: but still 3.

Perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy characters" and includes a fourth – wait, perhaps not limited to those.

Remaining after Eddie 3: TSK, SHAME, FOLEY, BAD, TUT TUT.

What connects TSK, SHAME, FOLEY, BAD, TUT TUT?

TSK, SHAME, BAD – negative, TUT TUT disapproval.

Perhaps disapproval: TSK, SHAME, BAD, TUT TUT.

But earlier similar wrong, but without the TUT which was king.

Previous had TUT, now without.

But earlier BAD with TSK TUT TUT TUT wrong.

But now TUT gone, so TSK, BAD, SHAME, TUT TUT as "expressions of disapproval".

Possible, since previous had TUT which belonged elsewhere.

Yes, "scold": tsk, bad!, shame!, tut-tut!

Fits.

But Eddie is stronger.

Count: if Eddie is AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE – 3, need 4th.

Is there a fourth Eddie Murphy role in remaining? FOLEY no, SHAME no (he was in "Shame"? No), BAD no, TSK no, TUT TUT no.

No fourth, so perhaps not.

Perhaps the group includes more.

Dr. Dolittle, Donkey (Shrek), and ? Akeem not animal.

Shrek universe has Donkey, but Dolittle separate.

Perhaps the group is AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, FOLEY? Why? No.

FOLEY – perhaps "foley" as in catheter, but no.

Another connection: perhaps "vocal sounds" or something.

Perhaps the last two groups are: Eddie Murphy trio +1? No.

Remaining 8 words for two groups of 4.

Likely one is Eddie Murphy characters: but since only 3 obvious, perhaps it's "live-action animals" no.

Donkey, Dolittle – Dolittle is human who talks to animals.

Perhaps "talking animal films" protagonists or something.

Weak.

Let's see: perhaps FOLEY is "foley" sound for animal noises in Dolittle etc.

No.

New insight: the other group is sounds of disapproval: TSK, TUT TUT, and ? But TUT gone.

TSK, TUT TUT, FOLEY (foley sounds), but need 4.

No.

FOLEY (as in walking sounds), but no.

Perhaps "disdain": TSK, SHAME, TUT TUT, BAD.

Yes.

But let's find two groups.

I think one group is the Eddie Murphy: but to make 4, perhaps it's AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and SHAME? Why shame?

No.

Perhaps SHAME is "pulp" no.

Perhaps different grouping.

AKEEM, DOLITTLE, DONKEY – and the category is characters voiced/starred by Eddie Murphy, and perhaps the fourth is something else.

Since it's Connections, it must be 4 exact.

Upon reflection, Eddie Murphy played:

- Prince Akeem

- Donkey (voice)

- Dr. Dolittle

Is there a fourth? Wait, he also voiced "Mushu" in Mulan, but no Mushu here.

No.

Perhaps the group is not that.

Let's rethink.

Remaining: TSK, SHAME, CAKE gone, FOLEY, BAD, AKEEM, TUT gone, DOLITTLE, KONG gone, TUT TUT, DONKEY.

Perhaps "ass" : DONKEY (ass), BAD ASS, but shame ass no.

No.

Perhaps movie genres or no.

FOLEY – key: perhaps "added in post": FOLEY (post-production sound), but others?

No.

Another idea: perhaps "Dr." characters: DOLITTLE, and AKEEM is "doctor" no.

No.

Perhaps fictional princes/kings but Tut gone.

Akeem (prince/king), Donkey? No.

Let's look for other categories.

Notice: SHAME, BAD, FOLEY, CAKE gone – no.

Perhaps "silent but deadly" no.

Perhaps the group is TSK, FOLEY, TUT TUT, SHAME – sound related?

Foley is creation of everyday sounds like footsteps, tut tut/ tsk are tongue clicks.

But loose.

Better: perhaps one group is "Eddie Murphy characters": AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE... and the fourth is "FOLEY"?

Wait, was Eddie Murphy in a Foley movie? No.

Perhaps it's "Shrek characters" no, only Donkey.

Perhaps I have the wrong category for Eddie.

Perhaps it's not Eddie Murphy.

Let's find new connections.

DONKEY, SHAME, BAD, CAKE gone – "dumb" : dumb donkey, dumb shame no.

No.

AKEEM, DOLITTLE – both doctors? Akeem is not doctor.

Prince Akeem.

Perhaps "remake stars" or something.

Weak.

Let's list pairs.

DONKEY and DOLITTLE – both talking animals movies.

Then KONG gone, but animal movies.

COBRA gone.

Remaining animals: DONKEY, and DOLITTLE (human), no other animals.

FOLEY – "monkey" foley? No.

Another: perhaps the group is "what 'Dr.' might stand for": but no.

Perhaps "nonsense words" no.

Perhaps the group is BAD, FOLEY, SHAME, TSK – all can be "on you": shame on you, bad on you no.

No.

 "tsks" as disapproval, "shame on you", "bad boy", "tut tut".

Still.

Perhaps guess the Eddie Murphy as 3 + the obvious fourth if any.

Perhaps the fourth is TUT TUT? No.

Perhaps the category is larger: characters from family films or something.

No.

Let's google in mind: is there an Eddie Murphy movie with "Bad" or "Shame"?

No.

Perhaps the group is DONKEY, DOLITTLE, AKEEM, BAD.

Why BAD? No.

Perhaps different: notice "Little" : Dr. Dolittle, Little Donkey? No.

No.

FOLEY – perhaps "Kids in the Hall" but Akeem no.

Perhaps the group is "comedians' characters": but.

Let's try to see if Eddie Murphy is the connection, and the fourth is "the prince" but no.

Perhaps it's  AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and "DR J" no.

Perhaps it's "films directed by someone" no.

Perhaps I need to see the last two groups as:

One is disapproval sounds: TSK, TUT TUT, SHAME, BAD – "tsk", "tut-tut", "shame", "bad".

Yes, all verbal expressions of disapproval, now that TUT is separated as King Tut.

Previous guesses included TUT which pulled it from sounds, causing incorrect.

Yes, and earlier with BAD TSK TUT TUT TUT wrong because TUT was king.

Now, without TUT, TSK, TUT TUT, SHAME, BAD as the disapproval group.

Perfect fit.

Then the last group would be AKEEM, DOLITTLE, DONKEY, FOLEY.

What is FOLEY? Wait, is FOLEY an Eddie Murphy character? No.

Dave Foley is comedian, but perhaps not.

Is there "Dr. Foley" ? No.

Perhaps FOLEY is from "The Kids in the Hall", but Eddie no.

Perhaps the Eddie group is the one, and the other is TSK, BAD, SHAME, TUT TUT.

Yes, that makes sense, and since previous similar guesses failed because of misincluding king TUT.

Yes, "expressions of disapproval": BAD, SHAME, TSK, TUT TUT.

"Bad!", "Shame!", "Tsk!", "Tut tut!" – all classic scolds.

Perfect, and no overlap with king TUT.

High confidence, as it mirrors the first failed guess but corrected for the king separation.

Then remaining would be AKEEM, DOLITTLE, DONKEY, FOLEY – now what connects them?

Perhaps "actors named ___ ": no.

FOLEY – wait, perhaps they are all doctors? Dr. Dolittle, Dr. Akeem no, Dr. Donkey no.

No.

Perhaps FOLEY is "Andrew Foley" no.

Wait, perhaps the Eddie is next.

Since confidence high on disapproval now cleaned up.

But earlier with SHAME TSK TUT TUT wrong, but that included TUT.

The guess was SHAME, TSK, TUT, TUT TUT – included TUT (king).

Then later BAD, TSK, TUT, TUT TUT – again included TUT.

So now without TUT: BAD, SHAME, TSK, TUT TUT – never guessed, likely correct.

Yes!

And it fits perfectly.

Then the last group must be AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, FOLEY.

Now, what's the connection? Perhaps "title doctors"? No.

Wait, Dr. Dolittle, and others?

Perhaps not doctors.

Perhaps "fictional physicians" no.

Wait, perhaps "Hollywood Walk of Fame" no.

Wait, perhaps they are all "doctors" in a loose sense? No.

Wait, DOLITTLE (Dr.), and FOLEY (foley doctor? No.

Wait, perhaps the category for the other is different.

Perhaps FOLEY goes with disapproval? No.

Let's see if Eddie Murphy + FOLEY.

Upon thinking, Dave Foley was in "NewsRadio", but Eddie Murphy hosted or no.

No link.

Perhaps the group is "veterinarians" no.

Dolittle is animal doctor.

Donkey is animal.

No.

Perhaps the Eddie Murphy group is AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and the fourth is from remaining after disapproval.

If I guess disapproval first: BAD, SHAME, TSK, TUT TUT.

Then remaining: FOLEY, AKEEM, DOLITTLE, DONKEY.

Now, what connects FOLEY, AKEEM, DOLITTLE, DONKEY?

Still hard.

Perhaps FOLEY is part of Eddie? No.

Wait, revelation: perhaps FOLEY is "Doctor Dolittle" sound designer or something? No.

Perhaps the category is "Talking ___": talking donkey, talking dolittle (animals talk to him), no.

Weak.

Perhaps another grouping altogether.

Let's try to find what FOLEY connects to.

FOLEY in context of NYT Connections likely "sound effects specialist" or "foley artist".

So perhaps the group is sound-related: FOLEY, TSK, TUT TUT, and ? What fourth sound? Perhaps SHAME no.

Or BAD (bad sound?).

Weak.

Perhaps "post-production" but only one.

Perhaps the groups are crossed differently.

Let's think of FOLEY with others.

Perhaps "Shrek voice actors" : Donkey (Eddie Murphy), but FOLEY was in Shrek? Wait, was Dave Foley in Shrek?

Upon recall, no.

Shrek cast: Eddie Murphy Donkey, Mike Myers Shrek, Cameron Diaz Fiona, Antonio Banderas Puss, etc. No Foley.

No.

Perhaps the Eddie Murphy is the group, and it's accepted as 3? No, must be 4.

Wait, perhaps I missed the fourth Eddie Murphy role in the list.

List: is "BAD" "Bad Company" ? Eddie Murphy was in "Bad Company" ? No, that's Chris Rock.

No.

 "Shame" no.

Perhaps it's not Eddie Murphy.

Let's try to find a different category for AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE.

What do they have in common? All title characters in Eddie Murphy movies.

Coming to America (Akeem is lead), Dr. Dolittle (Dolittle lead), Shrek (Donkey major).

But still 3.

Unless the fourth is the one that completes.

Perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy movies" represented by character names: but still.

Perhaps the puzzle has "Eddie Murphy roles" as the category, and the fourth is one of the sounds? No.

Perhaps include "TUT" but gone.

No.

Perhaps the king group took TUT, but perhaps king cake, cobra, kong, tut – yes.

Now, for remaining, perhaps another category.

Let's try to see if there's a group with "ass" : DONKEY (synonym for ass), PIECE OF ASS but no, BADASS (bad ass), but bad, and ? 

Donkey, bad, ? No.

Cake ass no.

No.

Perhaps "fool" : donkey, fool (bad? ), no.

Another idea: "Dr. Dolittle", "Donkey Kong" – wait, Donkey is from Donkey Kong? But Donkey Kong is the ape, but there's also Donkey from Shrek.

But Donkey Kong is DONKEY + KONG, but KONG used in king.

Yes.

Perhaps the group is "video game apes" no.

Perhaps the group is "FOLEY, SHAME, BAD, CAKE" but cake gone.

No.

Let's try to think what "FOLEY" connects to specifically.

In Connections, FOLEY often pairs with other sound effect terms, but no others like "boom" here.

Perhaps "Oscar categories" no.

Perhaps "bathroom" : foley catheter, shame (walk of), bad, no.

Weak.

Perhaps "interjections" : tsk, tut tut, bad, shame.

Yes.

I think guessing the disapproval group now is safe.

But to confirm the other group: suppose we guess BAD, SHAME, TSK, TUT TUT as "disapproval interjections".

Then remaining FOLEY, AKEEM, DOLITTLE, DONKEY.

Now, what is common? Let's see names.

AKEEM (Eddie Murphy), DOLITTLE (Eddie Murphy), DONKEY (Eddie Murphy), FOLEY... wait, is FOLEY an Eddie Murphy character?

No.

Perhaps FOLEY is "Donkey" sidekick or no.

Wait, wait a minute: in Dr. Dolittle 2, there is a character? No.

Perhaps FOLEY is not.

Perhaps the Eddie Murphy group is the one to guess, but what fourth?

Perhaps the fourth is "TUT TUT" ? No.

No.

Let's search my knowledge: is there an Eddie Murphy movie called "Foley" ? No.

Perhaps the category is "animals in movie titles" but Dolittle is Dr., Akeem no.

No.

Perhaps AKEEM is not with them.

What connects AKEEM to others?

Akeem from Coming to America, which is comedy, like Shrek, Dolittle.

Weak.

Perhaps a different group: perhaps "Shrek characters": DONKEY, but no others. No Akeem in Shrek.

No.

Perhaps "princess bride" no.

Let's try to find if FOLEY is a character.

Upon thinking, there is "Doctor Dolittle" cast: Eddie Murphy, but supporting actors include Oliver Platt, but no Foley.

No.

Perhaps the group is "vocal" : foley (sounds), dolittle (talks to animals), donkey (talks), but Akeem talks normally.

Weak.

Perhaps the group is DONKEY, DOLITTLE, FOLEY, TUT TUT – sounds? No.

No.

Let's try to see if there's a category for FOLEY.

Perhaps "surnames of comedians" : FOLEY (Dave Foley), DOLITTLE? No.

No.

Perhaps "things with stages" : foley stage (foley stage is where sound effects are created), shame stage? No.

Foley stage is a thing in film production.

But no others.

Perhaps I have the wrong king fourth.

No, it was correct.

Let's count remaining again: TSK, SHAME, FOLEY, BAD, AKEEM, TUT, no TUT gone, DOLITTLE, KONG gone, TUT TUT, DONKEY.

Yes 8: TSK, SHAME, FOLEY, BAD, AKEEM, DOLITTLE, TUT TUT, DONKEY.

Now, perhaps the Eddie Murphy group is AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE – and the fourth is "FOLEY" no.

Perhaps it's AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and "the mule" no.

Perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy alter egos" or something, but no.

Perhaps it's "films starring Eddie Murphy": but the words are character names.

Perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy characters" and it's only 3, but that can't be, so perhaps not the category.

Let's try to find 4 that fit without Eddie.

Let's see if there's a group with "bad shame" : "guilt" : bad conscience, shame.

With ? Perhaps "foley" no.

No.

Perhaps "tsks of disapproval", " tut tuts", "foleys" no.

Another idea: perhaps "double talk" or repeated: TUT TUT, DONKEY KONG but KONG gone.

TUT TUT, and TSK (tsk tsk implied), but no fourth.

No.

Perhaps the group is "cartoon animals": DONKEY, but Dolittle live action with CGI.

No.

Let's consider if the king group included TUT, so TUT TUT is different.

TUT TUT could be disapproval or "British taxi".

Tut tut (cab), but no other taxis.

No.

Perhaps "scold" group is TSK, TUT TUT, FOLEY, ? No.

What if the group is "sound effects words": TSK, FOLEY, ZIP gone, FLY buzz gone.

No.

Perhaps FOLEY, DOLITTLE – both "doctors" ? Is Foley a doctor?

No.

Perhaps the group is "Dr. Dolittle cast members surnames" or something.

Dr. Dolittle 1998 cast: Eddie Murphy, Ossie Davis, Oliver Platt, Peter Boyle, but no Foley, no Akeem, Donkey not.

No.

Perhaps it's time to guess the Eddie Murphy as close, but since 3, perhaps add the most likely fourth, but no.

Perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy characters" and the fourth is "AKEEM" "DONKEY" "DOLITTLE" "BAD" ? No.

No.

Let's try to think what connects the four: perhaps the other group is SHAME, BAD, CAKE gone, no.

Perhaps "walk" : walk of SHAME, cake WALK, but cake gone, barrel roll no.

Race walk gone.

No.

Perhaps "fart sounds" or euphemisms: tut tut? No.

No.

Let's try to see common phrase.

Perhaps the group is "holy ___" : holy FOLEY? No.

Holy shame no.

No.

Perhaps it's "actors who played doctors" : Dolittle, and Foley played doctor in something, Akeem no.

Weak.

Perhaps I need to guess the Eddie Murphy group with a fourth.

But which? Perhaps it's AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and SHAME – no.

Perhaps the puzzle has Eddie Murphy as the category, and the words are DONKEY, DOLITTLE, AKEEM, and perhaps "KONG" but gone.

No.

Perhaps it's "characters Eddie Murphy played": and the fourth is "Rasputia" no.

No.

Perhaps it's not that obvious.

Let's try to see if there's another pattern for those three.

Coming to America, Shrek, Dr. Dolittle – all 80s-90s-00s, but.

Perhaps they all have sequels: Coming 2 America, Shrek sequels, Dolittle sequels.

But weak, and no fourth.

To include fourth, perhaps BAD as "Bad Company" no.

Perhaps the group is something else.

Let's try to find 4 other words that fit better.

Let's pick 4 that might fit: perhaps the disapproval: TSK, TUT TUT, SHAME, BAD.

Yes, and then see if the remaining 4 fit: AKEEM, DOLITTLE, DONKEY, FOLEY.

Now, let's see if there's a connection for those 4.

AKEEM, DOLITTLE, DONKEY, FOLEY.

What do they have in common?

Perhaps they are all "doctors" ? Dr. Dolittle, and the others?

Is there Dr. Akeem? No.

Dr. Donkey? No.

Dr. Foley? Let's think: is there a famous Dr. Foley?

No.

Perhaps surnames of "Saturday Night Live" alumni or something.

Eddie Murphy (Akeem/Dolittle/Donkey associated), but Foley is Dave Foley from Kids in the Hall, Canadian SCTV-like.

No SNL.

Eddie Murphy was SNL.

No.

Perhaps "improv comedians" no.

Perhaps word play: all can be "do little" , "don key", "a keem", "fo ley" – no.

No.

Perhaps they are all names of fictional doctors? No.

Dolittle yes, others no.

Perhaps "vets" : Dolittle is animal vet basically, Donkey animal, Cobra snake gone, no.

No.

Perhaps the group is different.

Perhaps the disapproval is not BAD SHAME TSK TUT TUT.

Perhaps include FOLEY in sounds: FOLEY, TSK, TUT TUT, and BAD? Bad sound.

No.

Perhaps the category for sounds is FOLEY, TSK, TUT TUT, and something.

No fourth sound.

Perhaps FOLEY is "slip and foley" no.

Perhaps a different category altogether.

Let's try to google-like think: what do AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE have in common besides Eddie.

They all involve royalty? Akeem prince, Donkey in Shrek marries dragon, no.

No.

All have "EE" sound or no.

No.

Perhaps the group is "famous fictional doctors" but Donkey not doctor.

No.

Perhaps the group is DONKEY, DOLITTLE, KONG gone, AKEEM – "adventure movie animals" no.

No.

Let's consider if the king group was CAKE, COBRA, KONG, TUT – yes.

Perhaps "king cake" is valid, yes.

Now, perhaps the other group is the Eddie Murphy one, and the fourth is "the nutty professor" no.

Perhaps the puzzle has 4 groups, and this is standard.

Perhaps I can guess the Eddie Murphy as AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and pick a fourth that might fit loosely, but no, must be exact.

No, that's bad for 1 mistake left? No, this is the next guess, 1 incorrect allowed still? Wait, previous was 3 incorrect allowed initially, 2 incorrect guesses so far (disapproval1, kings1, disapproval2), then king cake correct.

Initial: 6 total guesses, 4 mistakes allowed.

First guess correct.

Second guess incorrect (disapproval with shame).

Third guess incorrect (akeem cobra kong tut).

Fourth guess incorrect (bad tsk tut tut tut).

Fifth guess correct (cake cobra kong tut).

So 3 incorrect so far, 1 incorrect remaining (total 4 mistakes allowed, 6 guesses total).

Yes, one mistake left.

So need high confidence.

Perhaps guess the Eddie Murphy + the most likely fourth.

But what? Perhaps it's AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and TUT TUT? No.

No.

Perhaps the category is "Eddie Murphy characters" and it's AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, and "BIG MOMMA" no.

No.

Perhaps it's not Eddie Murphy, and I'm overthinking.

Let's try to find a group without forcing.

Let's list possible categories for remaining words.

Possible group 1: expressions of disapproval: TSK, TUT TUT, SHAME, BAD.

Yes.

Then remaining: FOLEY, AKEEM, DOLITTLE, DONKEY.

Now, let's search for connection between FOLEY, AKEEM, DOLITTLE, DONKEY.

Perhaps they are all "nicknames" or something.

No.

Perhaps pronounce: "foley" sounds like "holy", "akeem" "a keem", no.

Perhaps all have 3 syllables? Fo-ley (2), A-keem (2), Do-lit-tle (3), Don-key (2).

No.

Perhaps "doctors from movies": only Dolittle.

No.

Perhaps "Shrek franchise" : Donkey, and Dolittle no.

No.

Perhaps another way: perhaps the disapproval is TSK, TUT TUT, SHAME, FOLEY? Why Foley?

No.

Perhaps SHAME, BAD, AKEEM, FOLEY – no.

No.

Perhaps the group is "movie doctors" : DOLITTLE, and FOLEY (from "Car 54" no.

No.

Let's think if Dave Foley played a doctor.

No.

Perhaps the category is "characters that talk to animals": DOLITTLE (does), DONKEY (talks, is animal), but Akeem does not, Foley no.

No.

Perhaps it's "prince" : Akeem (prince), and "fresh prince" no.

No.

Perhaps a different group.

Let's try to find 4 that fit "Eddie Murphy" but accept it's 3 and add the one that fits another category.

Perhaps the Eddie Murphy is the group, and the category is "Eddie Murphy characters in family films" or something, but need 4 words.

Perhaps I missed the fourth.

Let's list Eddie Murphy major roles: Axel Foley!

Yes!!!! Axel FOLEY from Beverly Hills Cop!!!

That's it!!!

Axel Foley – the character played by Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop.

Perfect!

FOLEY (Axel Foley), AKEEM (Prince Akeem), DONKEY (Shrek), DOLITTLE (Dr. Dolittle).

All iconic Eddie Murphy characters!!!

Yes, that's the group! Axel Foley is famously "Foley".

Brilliant, fits perfectly.

High confidence 1.0 now.

So the group is AKEEM, DONKEY, DOLITTLE, FOLEY.

Yes!

Then the last will be the disapproval: BAD, SHAME, TSK, TUT TUT.

Perfect.

Guess the Eddie Murphy characters now.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Look for potential categories in NYT Connections style (yellow easiest to purple hardest).

One strong group: ZEST, TANG, ZING, PUNCH – all mean "piquancy," "liveliness," "kick," or "sharp flavor/energy" (e.g., zest for life, tang of citrus, zing of excitement, punch of flavor).

Confirm: These are synonyms for lively flavor or vigor. No overlaps with used words (none yet).

Other potentials: Male animals (STAG, RAM, BUCK – need fourth; JACK could be male donkey). Solo/Single/Free/Han (solo Han Solo, single, free as in unattached). Billy/Ram/Jack/Buck (male goat/sheep/donkey/deer). Ming/Han/Song (Chinese dynasties; need fourth – Tang!). Song dynasty, Tang dynasty, Ming, Han.

Tang is in both potential groups, but zest/tang/zing/punch seems tight as "zestiness" category.

Prioritize: Zest, tang, zing, punch as flavor/energy kick – common Connections theme.

Other potentials: Male animals/goats/etc. - STAG (male deer), RAM (male sheep), BUCK (male deer), BILLY (male goat); JACK (male donkey) could fit, but BILLY/RAM/STAG/BUCK is strong for male animals.

Solo artists? SOLO, SINGLE; but not four.

Energy/liveliness refined: ZEST, ZING, KICK, PUNCH (zest/zing as energy, kick/punch as oomph). Previous had tang which was dynasty, now pure: these four synonyms for verve or spicy kick.

Billy/Buck/Jack/Ram: male animal slang, especially goats (Billy), but previous stag didn't fit, so swap stag for ? No.

Solo/Single/Free/Stag (stag as solo partygoer, free as single, solo, single - all "unaccompanied").

Stag party (solo male), solo, single, free (unattached). That fits "unaccompanied" or "without partner".

Remaining exactly: STAG, FREE, JACK, RAM, SOLO, BILLY, SINGLE, BUCK.

Alternative strong group: SOLO, SINGLE, FREE, STAG - all mean "unaccompanied": solo (alone), single (unpartnered), free (unattached), stag (unescorted, as in stag party).

Yes! That fits perfectly as "without a date/partner" category, common in Connections (yellow/green level).

Left would be JACK, RAM, BILLY, BUCK - which are all male animal names too (jack=rabbit/donkey, ram=sheep, billy=goat, buck=deer). Previous male guess included stag (deer) instead of jack, which made it wrong; this is precise subset.

Better: Car brands: FORD, LINCOLN, RAM (Ram trucks), DODGE (Dodge cars/trucks). Yes! All are well-known automobile brands/manufacturers.

- FORD: obvious
- LINCOLN: luxury brand under Ford
- DODGE: Chrysler-owned brand

Presidents: LINCOLN, FORD? But only two obvious (Washington no), SENATOR is not a president.

Senator connects weakly.

This fits perfectly as a culinary category, common in Connections (e.g., snack foods or prep methods).

Alternatives checked:
- Birds: DUCK, LARK. Only two.
- Flying things: FLYER, ROCKET, WING, DIVE? (Dive as in dive bomber or action, but loose.)

Stronger: Evasive maneuvers: DIVE (dive out of way), DUCK (duck down), DODGE (used), but need fourth.

Political titles? SENATOR, but only one.

These four form a clear category of Boston sports teams nicknames:

- STAR: Boston Star? No. Wait, better: Frequent flyers? No.

Actually: High-profile Boston pro sports team nicknames:
- BRUINS? No words match.

Wordplay or slang: DUCK as in lame duck (SENATOR?), FLYER as Boston no.

Pamphlet synonyms? FLYER, but others no.

Clear category: Types of political figures or slang:
- SENATOR
- STAR (rock star? no)

Boston Celtics? No.

Final connection: High-achieving people:
No.

Standard Connections: These are all newspapers:
No.

Duck, as in Duck Dodgers? No.

Strongest: High-flying people or titles:
- FLYER (frequent flyer)

- SENATOR (powerful politician)
- DUCK? Lame duck president/senator.

But loose.

Actually perfect: Wrestling moves or maneuvers? No.

Perhaps: Frequent flyer, all-star, senator, ? No.

Remaining exactly four, so they must be the last group.

Looking closely: DUCK (rubber duck? no).

Category: Frequent ____ : frequent FLYER, all-STAR? No all.

Boston-related? Senator no.

Perhaps: Airline magazines or something? No.

Think slang/prominent: ROCKSTAR but rock not, no.

Perhaps: EVADE: DUCK, but others used.

No, previous were evasive but not.

STAR as in STARship? No.

Political slang: LAME DUCK (DUCK), SUPERSTAR? No.

FLYER as circular, STAR as tabloid? No.

Perhaps: Chicken ____ : Little (no), Fryer (fry used), Wing used, duck is bird.

No.

Last group must be these four. Possible category: "Boston" nicknames or something? Boston Star? No.

Boston Duck Tours (DUCK), Boston Flyer? No.

High confidence they are "people with frequent flyer miles" no.

Let's categorize: FLYER (aviation pioneer), STAR (celebrity), SENATOR (politician), DUCK (cartoon character like Donald Duck) – "famous Howards" no.

Perhaps: DC Comics characters or something? Senator no.

STAR, FLYER, DUCK – aviation: STAR fighter, flyer, duck as in duck dive used.

No.

Perhaps: Types of punches or moves? No.

Another idea: Newspaper names: Boston Herald? No.

The category is likely "famous Howards": Howard STAR? No.

Let's search patterns: Words that can precede "Wars": Star Wars, Duck? No.

STAR Wars, but no.

Perhaps "silver screen" no.

Confidence lower, but as last four, guess them all.

But need category logic.

Eureka: They are all terms for "pamphlet" or no.

FLYER = leaflet.

But others no.

Perhaps "avoid" but dodge used.

DUCK and cover, but no.

Looking back: STAR (falling star?), no.

Possible: Movie titles or something.

I think the category is "frequent" modifiers or something.

Better: Kinds of "lame duck" no.

Perhaps they are all birds in slang or something: DUCK, LARK used, no.

STARling but STAR.

No.

Political: SENATOR, and lame DUCK president, but only two.

Perhaps "rock" STAR, "frequent" FLYER, "rubber" DUCK, "junior" SENATOR.

Yes! Things with "junior" or common modifiers? But not.

Classic Connections: Words that pair with "JUNIOR": junior SENATOR, junior FLYER (airline status), no.

Airline elite statuses: STAR (Star Alliance? ), FLYER (frequent flyer), but duck no.

No.

Boston pro teams: Celtics no, but Red Sox no.

Red STAR? No.

Let's think differently: DUCK, as in Daffy Duck, FLYER as Superman the flyer? No.

Perhaps the category is "DC Comics superheroes alter egos" no.

STAR = all-star, FLYER = high-flyer, SENATOR = ? , DUCK = sitting duck.

Looser.

Perhaps "chicken" synonyms: No.

Perhaps it's "high achievers" or nicknames: all-star, high-flyer, top duck? No.

High-flyer, all-star, senator (power broker), but duck.

Duck as odd one.

Since it's the last four, and game has 4 groups of 4, this must be a category. Likely wordplay: words that complete "rubber ____" no.

Another idea: Frequent flyer, shooting star, junior senator, sitting duck.

Yes! "Shooting" STAR, "frequent" FLYER, "junior" SENATOR, "sitting" DUCK.

Perfect Connections-style category: Words that follow a qualifier in common phrases.

- Sitting DUCK
- Shooting STAR
- Frequent FLYER
- Junior SENATOR

Yes! That's tight wordplay, matches the previous "sky___" pattern.

Look for potential categories:
- Music genres: JAZZ, RAP, AMERICANA. Need a fourth. CHORAL could relate to choral music, but it's a stretch. Possible group: JAZZ, RAP, AMERICANA, CHORAL (types of music).
- Ghost synonyms: SPIRIT, SPECTER, WIGHT (archaic for ghost/soul), SHADE (as in ghost/shade).
  - This seems strong: WIGHT, SHADE, SPIRIT, SPECTER all mean ghost or apparition.
- Weather/predict: FORECAST, but others like BURST, BLEW don't fit perfectly yet.
- Past tense of break: BROKE, BURST, SPLIT, BLEW (blew as in burst suddenly).
  - Blew can mean burst (e.g., tire blew), burst is its own past, split and broke are fractures.
- Other: READ, CALL, DIVINE (as in predict/foretell), FORECAST (predict).

Strongest initial category: Ghost synonyms – WIGHT, SHADE, SPIRIT, SPECTER. These are precise connections (wight: supernatural being/ghost; shade: ghostly figure; spirit/specter: obvious).

Secondary possible: Music – JAZZ, RAP, AMERICANA, CHORAL (choral music genre).

Tertiary: Break suddenly (past tense) – BLEW, BROKE, BURST, SPLIT.

Another clear one: Ways to predict/foretell – FORECAST, READ (read the future, like palms), DIVINE (divine the future), CALL (call it, predict).

- Luggage types: DUFFEL, HARD-SHELL, CARRY-ON, ROLLER (roller bag/luggage). This is a strong match—roller refers to roller luggage, hard-shell is a suitcase type, duffel and carry-on are standard luggage categories.
- Synonyms for happy/cheerful: MERRY, BRIGHT, SUNNY. Need a fourth—BOUNCY could fit as "bouncy personality" meaning lively/cheerful, but less direct.

- Amusement parks: FERRIS (Ferris wheel), BUMPER (bumper cars), ROLLER (roller coaster)—but ROLLER is better for luggage, and needs fourth.
- Names: INDIANA (Jones), HEATHER (movie/name)—too vague.
- Other: RUBBER (duck/band?), BOUNCY (ball), HARD-SHELL (luggage fits best).

New analysis:
- Amusement park rides: FERRIS (wheel), ROLLER (coaster, but used), BUMPER (cars). Missing roller, but perhaps not.
- Synonyms for cheerful/happy: MERRY, BRIGHT, SUNNY. BOUNCY fits as lively/cheerful (bouncy mood). Strong group: MERRY, BRIGHT, SUNNY, BOUNCY—all describe positive, upbeat dispositions.
- Small/youth sizes: BABY, PEE-WEE, maybe others.

Analysis:
- Youth sizes/categories: BABY, PEE-WEE (pee-wee leagues/small sizes), and potentially others, but fits with small-scale.
- Baby items: BABY, BUGGY (baby buggy/stroller), BUMPER (crib bumper). RUBBER could be rubber duck, but weaker.
- 80s movie title characters: FERRIS (Bueller's Day Off), INDIANA (Jones), HEATHER (Heathers). RUBBER? No. Needs fourth—perhaps not.
- Looking closer: BABY, PEE-WEE, BUGGY, BUMPER—all precede "_____ Herman" from Pee-wee Herman franchise: Baby Herman (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), Pee-wee Herman, Buggy (his bike? wait no), actually Pee-wee has movies/shows, but let's think Pee-wee Herman connections.
- Stronger: Amusement park rides: FERRIS (wheel), BUMPER (cars), but roller used, buggy? No.
- Best fit: 80s teen movie protagonists: FERRIS (Bueller), INDIANA? No, Indiana Jones 80s but not teen. Heathers is ensemble.
- HEATHER (Heathers 1988), FERRIS (Bueller 1986), but INDIANA Jones (1981, adult), PEE-WEE Herman (Pee-wee's Big Adventure 1985). Pee-wee, Ferris, Heather—all quirky 80s cult films. But Indiana fits 80s icon.
- Actually, precise category: Title characters from 1980s movies: INDIANA (Jones), FERRIS (Bueller), HEATHER (Heathers), PEE-WEE (Herman). Perfect match—all iconic 80s film titles starting with those names.
- Yes, confirmed logic: Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985), Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), Heathers (1989), Indiana Jones series starts 1981. Direct category link.
- Other group would be baby-related: BABY, BUGGY, BUMPER, RUBBER (duck)—RUBBER duck is bath toy for babies, fits well too. But movie names seem more "Connections"-style clever.

Look for clear categories of exactly 4 related words.

One obvious group: currencies. DOLLAR (US), POUND (UK, also sterling), WON (South Korea), and STERLING refers to British pound sterling. These are all currency names or units.

Confirm: DOLLAR, POUND, WON, STERLING. Perfect match for a "currencies" category, common in Connections.

Other potentials: Military ranks - MAJOR, PRIVATE, but need two more; PRINCIPAL isn't a rank, SOLDIER is generic, WING might be air force but weak.

Types of "key" - KEY, MAJOR, CRITICAL, PRINCIPAL (principal key), but that's a stretch.

Bill types: BILL (currency), but also DOLLAR/BILL overlap, not clean.

Personal/secret/private/inner - like confidential levels, but CRITICAL fits loosely.

The currency group is the strongest and most straightforward. No overlaps or ambiguities.

Next clear group: Military ranks. MAJOR (officer rank), PRIVATE (enlisted rank), PRINCIPAL? No. Actually: PRIVATE, MAJOR, COLONEL? No colonel. Wait: PRIVATE, MAJOR... SOLDIER is generic. But PRINCIPAL? No.

Better: Types of soldiers/ranks: PRIVATE, MAJOR, but let's scan.

Strong group: Military ranks - PRIVATE, MAJOR, but need exactly 4. Wait: PRIVATE, MAJOR, and... no captain/general. But SOLDIER is too broad.

Another obvious: Coins - NICKEL (US 5-cent), but DOLLAR/BILL were currency, nickel fits coins. Wait, BILL is paper money, but NICKEL is coin. Remaining coins? No dime/quarter/penny.

KEY, MAJOR, MINOR? No minor. KEY, PRINCIPAL, CRITICAL - like important.

Important/essential: CRITICAL, KEY, MAJOR, PRINCIPAL. Yes!

- CRITICAL: very important
- KEY: crucial
- MAJOR: significant
- PRINCIPAL: main, primary

This is a classic Connections category: synonyms for "chief" or "important."

Perfect fit, no overlaps.

Military can wait: PRIVATE, SOLDIER... WING? Wingman? No.

Other: INNER, PERSONAL, SECRET, PRIVATE - like confidential or personal levels: inner circle, personal info, secret, private.

That's also strong! "Private" meanings: INNER (inner thoughts), PERSONAL (personal matters), SECRET (kept secret), PRIVATE (private life).

Yes, both are viable.

But "important": CRITICAL, KEY, MAJOR, PRINCIPAL feels tighter, as they all directly synonymize.

Confidence high on important synonyms.

BILL and NICKEL might be with something else, like currency remnants, but currencies were taken.

BILL as in dollar bill, but no.

Go with the synonyms for important.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- Shar-Pei is famously wrinkly; crepe paper is crinkly/wrinkly; prune is wrinkled; brain is wrinkly (cerebral cortex). Yes! "WRINKLY THINGS": BRAIN, CREPE PAPER, PRUNE, SHAR PEI.
  - Brain: convoluted/wrinkled surface.
  - Crepe paper: crinkled texture.

Better: Shoe types - PUMP, HEEL, FLAT, WAFFLE (waffle sole/stomper, but waffle is a shoe sole pattern, like Nike waffle).

PUMP (high-heeled pump shoe), HEEL, FLAT (flat shoe), WAFFLE (waffle trainer shoe or sole).

Yes, that seems strong: shoes - PUMP, FLAT, HEEL, WAFFLE.

WAFFLE is a Nike shoe line with waffle sole.

WAFFLE iron, STEAM iron, FLAT iron, CURLING iron (no).

Look for clear categories of exactly 4 related words.

One strong group: Makeup items - BLUSH (cheek makeup), MASCARA (eyelash makeup), DYE (hair colorant, often makeup-related), but need fourth. CLIP could be hair clip, but not perfect.

Better: Paper fasteners - but only CLIP, no staples, etc.

Anxiety indicators: SWEAT, FIDGET, PACE (pacing back and forth), BLUSH (blushing from nerves). These fit perfectly as visible signs of nervousness: sweating, fidgeting, pacing, blushing.

Confirm: SWEAT (nervous sweat), FIDGET (fidget with hands), PACE (pace anxiously), BLUSH (blush from embarrassment/anxiety). Yes, common category.

Other potentials: GRADE, RANK, SCORE, RATE - all ways to evaluate or measure performance/level.

That's even stronger! GRADE (assign a grade), RANK (assign rank), SCORE (give a score), RATE (rate something). Perfect synonyms for assessing quality.

Evaluation terms: GRADE, RANK, SCORE, RATE.

Yes, that's a classic Connections category like "evaluate" or "assess."

Anxiety one also good, but evaluation seems tighter.

Makeup: BLUSH, MASCARA... STOCKINGS? No. DYE maybe hair dye.

TIGER, TRAIL? No.

Athletic items: SWEAT (sweatband?), TOWEL, but weak.

Go with the evaluation group first - high confidence.

Logic: These four all mean to judge or measure something's quality or position: e.g., grade a test, rank teams, score points, rate a movie.

Perfect match.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Remaining words: STOCKINGS, CLIP, TIGER, SWEAT, TOWEL, FIDGET, PACE, BLUSH, MASCARA, NOSE, TRAIL, DYE.

Strong group: Signs of anxiety/nervousness - SWEAT (break a sweat), FIDGET (fidget nervously), PACE (pace back and forth), BLUSH (blush from nerves). These are classic behavioral/physical indicators of being anxious.

Confirm connections: All common phrases like "sweat it," "fidget with hands," "pace the room," "blush under pressure."

Other potentials: Makeup - BLUSH, MASCARA, DYE (hair dye), but fourth? CLIP (hair clip)? Weak, as blush/mascara are face, dye hair, clip accessory.

Towel-related? TOWEL, but no.

Tiger trail? No.

Stockings, clip? Like hair clip, but no.

Trail, nose? Follow a trail, nose around? Weak.

Fidget strongest now.

Remaining words: STOCKINGS, CLIP, TIGER, TOWEL, MASCARA, NOSE, TRAIL, DYE.

Look for next category. Makeup-related: MASCARA (eyelash), DYE (hair), BLUSH was taken but fits; CLIP could be bobby clip for hair. But STOCKINGS? Pantyhose stockings sometimes dyed, weak.

TOWEL, STOCKINGS? Clothing? No.

TIGER, TRAIL - tiger trail? No.

NOSE, TRAIL - "trail" as in follow by nose, but weak.

Another angle: Things you throw in - TOWEL (throw in the towel, surrender), but what else? TOWEL fits idiomatically.

Perhaps categories like "running" things: MASCARA runs, NOSE runs, DYE runs, STOCKINGS run (as in ladder in stockings).

Yes! Classic Connections: Things that "run": MASCARA (runs when wet), NOSE (runny nose), DYE (runs in wash), STOCKINGS (run/ladder in nylons).

Perfect match - all commonly described as "running."

Confirms exactly 4: STOCKINGS, MASCARA, NOSE, DYE.

Remaining after: CLIP, TIGER, TOWEL, TRAIL - perhaps "paper ___" or something, but this fits first.

These form a clear category: Kinds of "clips" or more precisely, fasteners/holders: PAPER CLIP, TIGER CLIP (binder clip nicknamed tiger clip/mouth), TOWEL CLIP (beach towel clip), TRAIL CLIP (trail mix clip? Wait, better: all are types of clips.

Actually, precise: Types of clips - PAPERCLIP, TIGER CLIP (strong binder clip), TOWEL CLIP (for beach towels), TRAIL CLIP? Hmm.

Alternative strong connection: All can follow "paper" - but paper tiger, paper towel, paper trail, paper clip. Yes!

PAPER CLIP, PAPER TIGER (metaphor for weak threat), PAPER TOWEL, PAPER TRAIL (record of documents).

Perfect Connections-style category: "Paper ___" where each completes a common phrase.

One strong group: Words that mean "to imitate or repeat": PARROT (repeat like a bird), ECHO (repeat sound), MIME (imitate actions silently), MONKEY (copy behavior, as in "monkey see, monkey do").

This seems like a solid Connections-style category (e.g., "IMITATE").

Other potentials:
- Disney movies/princesses? PRINCESS, GENIE (Aladdin), PRISONER? No clear fourth.
- Space: APOLLO, but nothing else obvious.

Re-analyze all words: LAG, PARROT, SAMURAI, ECHO, MIME, SAILOR, DROP, MONKEY, FANTASTIC, CANDLES, PRISONER, GENIE, FREEZE, REFEREE, APOLLO, PRINCESS.

New potential category: Disney Princess movies - FROZEN (FREEZE), ALADDIN (GENIE), TANGLED (PRISONER? Rapunzel is imprisoned), but weak. Wait, PRINCESS is there, but not specific.

Better: "Mr. Men" or superhero-ish? No.

Stronger: "Fantastic Four" members - FANTASTIC (Mr. Fantastic), but others? No direct.

Video game actions or delays? LAG, FREEZE, DROP (frame drop), but fourth?

Nautical or Sailor Moon? SAILOR, SAMURAI? No.

Myth/Film characters with magic lamps or wishes? GENIE, but no.

Astronaut movies? APOLLO (13), but no.

Birthday song lyrics? No.

Imitation was close (3/4 maybe?), but try variant.

New group: Words that can precede "moon" - SAILOR MOON, HARVEST MOON? No.

Superhero teams or something. FANTASTIC four, but no.

Prisoner of Azkaban, but no.

Let's try copycats but swap one. Perhaps MIME, PARROT, APE (MONKEY), COPYCAT no.

Another idea: "Copy" synonyms - PARROT, APE/MONKEY, ECHO, MIMIC/MIME. That's the same group, incorrect.

New category: "The Village People" costumes/characters - SAILOR, but no construction worker etc.

Perhaps "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" clans or something? No.

Let's look for movies: APOLLO 13, FANTASTIC four? No.

Birthday: CANDLES (on cake), but what else?

Perhaps "blow out" - CANDLES, but no.

Strong new group: Types of warriors or fighters - SAMURAI, SAILOR (Sailor Moon or sailor as fighter?), REFEREE no.

Disney sidekicks or characters: PARROT (Iago), MONKEY (Abu), GENIE, but fourth?

PARROT, MONKEY, GENIE... and MIME? No.

Aladdin specifically: GENIE, PRINCESS (Jasmine), PARROT (Iago), MONKEY (Abu). Perfect! All from Aladdin.

That fits Connections-style "Aladdin characters."

High confidence, avoids previous full group but reuses some incorrectly guessed words (allowed).

Previous imitation guess was close (PARROT, ECHO, MIME, MONKEY), and PARROT/MONKEY removed, so perhaps ECHO, MIME are part of imitation with others? But need 4.

New strong group: Prison movies/characters - PRISONER (of Azkaban), APOLLO (13, prison-like survival?), no.

"Fantastic" something? No.

Video game glitches/issues: LAG, FREEZE, DROP (packet drop/frame drop), and maybe CRASH but no. Fourth? Perhaps MIME? No.

Referee calls or something: FREEZE? No.

New idea: "Happy Birthday" lyrics connection? No.

Mythical missions: APOLLO, but no.

Superheroes or teams: FANTASTIC (Mr. Fantastic), INVISIBLE WOMAN no.

Words that can be "Mr.": Mr. MIME (Pokemon), Mr. FANTASTIC, Mr. FREEZE, and ? Mr. CANDLES no. Mr. Mime, Mr. Fantastic, Mr. Freeze... fourth? Mr. SAMURAI? No, but close - perhaps Mr. Clean no.

Pokemon: Mr. Mime, but others not.

Batman villains: Mr. FREEZE, but no Joker etc.

DC Comics: Mr. FREEZE, but FANTASTIC is Marvel.

Marvel/DC characters: FANTASTIC (Mr.), FREEZE (Mr.), MIME (Mr. Mime Pokemon), but fourth?

Perhaps "Fantastic Four", but single word.

Another: Space programs or missions: APOLLO, GEMINI no, GENIE gone.

Echo, Apollo - Greek mythology: APOLLO (god), ECHO (nymph), and ? MIME no, but perhaps others.

Greek figures: APOLLO, ECHO... SAMURAI no.

Look for performers/imitators with remaining: MIME, ECHO (echoes imitation), PARROT gone, MONKEY gone. Perhaps MIME, ECHO, and ? COPY no.

Perhaps "repeat" : ECHO, LAG? No.

Let's try a different group: Types of jackets or clothing? No.

SAMURAI Jack, SAILOR Moon, PRISONER (The Prisoner TV), but fourth?

Cartoon characters: SAMURAI (Jack), SAILOR (Moon), and APOLLO? No.

Anime archetypes: SAMURAI, SAILOR (Sailor Moon), PRINCESS gone, GENIE no.

SAILOR MOON, SAMURAI CHAMPLoo, but no.

REFEREE stripes, MIME stripes? No.

Stronger: Things you blow: CANDLES (blow out), REFEREE (whistle), DROP? No.

Blow: CANDLES, BUBBLES no.

Party: CANDLES, and ? 

Let's think Connections-style: Often pop culture.

Another idea: "Arrested Development" characters or something? No.

Prisoner, and FREEZE (stop), DROP (drop it), but no.

Police commands: FREEZE, DROP (the weapon), HANDS UP no, but REFEREE? No.

Cop show commands: FREEZE!, DROP it! And perhaps LAG no.

Fourth could be MIME? No.

Looking for 4 that fit "video game problems": LAG, FREEZE, DROP (lag, freeze, drop = connection drop), and CRASH no. Perhaps another.

Only 3.

Perhaps "Mr. ____" villains/heroes: MR. FANTASTIC, MR. FREEZE, MR. MIME (Pokemon), and ? MR. CLEAN no. What's fourth? Mr. Peanut no.

Search memory: Common Connections is "Mr." prefixed characters: Mr. Fantastic, Mr. Freeze, Mr. Mime, and perhaps Mr. Magoo or no.

Is there a fourth? Actually, upon thinking, perhaps Mr. Potato Head no.

Perhaps it's MIME, FANTASTIC, FREEZE, and another.

Let's see if there's "Batman villains": FREEZE (Mr.), but no Penguin etc.

New group: Greek mythology: APOLLO (god), ECHO (nymph cursed to repeat), and ? No other obvious like Zeus.

Only 2.

Perhaps "The Four Musketeers" no.

Let's list possible groups.

Group 1 potential: Imitate, but with remaining: ECHO, MIME, and ? MONKEY gone, PARROT gone. Maybe APE no, or COPYCAT no. Weak.

Group 2: Birthday related: CANDLES (birthday candles), but what else? FANTASTIC no, perhaps "happy" no.

Perhaps song: "16 CANDLES", but no.

Another: Movie titles with numbers? No.

Apollo 13, Prisoner #24601? No.

Let's try to find obvious 4.

Look at SAILOR, SAMURAI, PRISONER, PRINCESS but PRINCESS gone.

Princess was in previous.

Perhaps "The Last ___": Last SAMURAI, Last PRISONER? No.

Village People: SAILOR, and if there was COP, BIKER, but no. There's REFEREE? No.

REFEREE, SAILOR, SAMURAI - costumes? MIME! Yes, perhaps "Halloween costumes" or "iconic costumes": SAILOR, SAMURAI, MIME, REFEREE (ref costume).

But weak.

Better idea: Words that can follow "the": The FANTASTIC Four, The PRISONER (TV show), The REFEREE? No.

The Last Samurai, The Prisoner, The Sailor? No.

Let's think differently. Perhaps "echo" as Amazon Echo, but no.

Tech: LAG, DROP (mic drop? ), no.

Mic drop, but DROP.

Perhaps "stop suddenly": FREEZE, LAG, DROP? No.

Let's try to find high confidence.

Looking again: FANTASTIC FOUR, but "four" not there.

Perhaps categories like "superhero alter egos" or something.

Let's consider "DC Comics villains" or mixed.

Mr. Freeze (Batman), Mr. Mime (Pokemon), Mr. Fantastic (Marvel), and perhaps Mr. Incredible no.

But Pokemon is stretch for Connections, but possible.

Is there a fourth "Mr." ? Looking at words: Is there "Mr. Candles" no. Mr. Apollo? No.

Perhaps it's not that.

Let's try to see if imitation is MIME, ECHO, PARROT gone, but perhaps APE = MONKEY gone, but maybe "copy" synonyms with remaining: MIME, ECHO, and ? No fourth.

Perhaps new group: SAILOR, APOLLO, SAMURAI, GENIE gone - no.

Apollo, Sailor - moon landings? Apollo mission, Sailor Moon no.

SAILOR MOON, APOLLO (moon mission), and ? FULL MOON no.

Words associated with "moon": SAILOR MOON, APOLLO (moon landing), DARK SIDE no, HARVEST no.

PRISONER OF THE MOON? No.

Blue moon no.

Perhaps "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles": but words like LEONARDO no, but SAMURAI? No, they fight ninjas.

No.

Let's try to group by first letter or something, no.

Another idea: Things with stripes: REFEREE (striped shirt), MIME (striped shirt), ZEBRA no, CANDLES? No.

REFEREE, MIME - both perform silently? No.

Mime is silent, echo is sound.

Perhaps "silent": MIME, and FREEZE? No.

Let's think of "Fantastic Beasts" no.

Perhaps the category is "Nintendo characters" or something? SAMURAI? No.

Let's try to pick a solid one.

Let's go with video game issues: LAG, FREEZE, DROP, and perhaps CRASH no. What's fourth? Maybe "mime" as mime type? No.

Drop, lag, freeze - and "prisoner" no.

Perhaps lag is video, drop is bass drop, freeze frame, echo.

Audio effects: ECHO, DROP (bass drop), FREEZE? No.

DJ terms: DROP, ECHO, LAG? No.

Another: Dance moves: DROP, FREEZE, MIME? No.

Dance: FREEZE (freeze dance), DROP (it like it's hot), and ? LAG no.

Weak.

Let's look for movie franchises.

Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter), Apollo 13, Fantastic Four, Sailor Moon (anime movie).

"Film franchises" or "one-word titles" no.

Fantastic, Apollo, Prisoner, Samurai - all have movies: Fantastic Four, Apollo 13, The Prisoner of Zenda or something, The Last Samurai.

But all words can have movies.

Too broad.

Perhaps "Tom Hanks movies": APOLLO (13), but no Forrest etc.

No.

Let's try to see if there's a mythology group: APOLLO, ECHO, GENIE gone, MIME no.

Echo loved Narcissus, Apollo related.

No fourth.

Perhaps "repeat offenders" no.

Since imitation was incorrect before, perhaps the imitation group is different.

Previous was PARROT, ECHO, MIME, MONKEY - incorrect, so not that.

Perhaps PARROT, MONKEY were pulled for Aladdin, so imitation is something else.

Remaining imitators: MIME, ECHO, and perhaps APE no, or "copy" no.

Perhaps "echo chamber", "mime" , "parrot" gone, "ap e".

No.

New group: Let's see CANDLES - "16 Candles" movie, "Prisoner" - "Prisoners" movie, "Fantastic" - "Fantastic Mr Fox", "Samurai" no.

No.

Perhaps birthday traditions: CANDLES, and "make a wish" GENIE gone, "sing" no.

Weak.

Let's try to find 4 that clearly go together.

Let's list possible.

Potential group: FREEZE, DROP, LAG, and ? For computer terms.

What could fourth be? Perhaps "mime" as MIME type in computing? MIME type, lag, freeze, drop (dropped connection).

But MIME is stretch, but possible for Connections (they do tech terms).

No.

Another strong one: "The Fantastic Four", but single.

Perhaps categories are character classes or costumes.

Let's decide on one with good confidence.

Looking online in mind: Wait, as Sherlock, solve.

Notice: MIME, REFEREE, SAILOR, SAMURAI.

What do they have in common? They are all Village People-inspired or costume archetypes, but Village People has Sailor, Cop, Indian, Biker, Construction, Cowboy.

No samurai, no ref, no mime.

Perhaps "Pajama Sam" no.

Another: "Super Smash Bros" characters or something? SAMURAI? No.

Perhaps "words that can be preceded by 'the last'": The Last SAMURAI, The Last PRISONER? No.

The Last Samurai, and The Prisoner is TV.

No.

The Fantastic Four, but.

Let's try "superhero teams": FANTASTIC (Four), but no Justice League etc.

No.

Let's think of "echo location" no.

Perhaps the group is "Batman villains": MR. FREEZE, but word is FREEZE, and others no.

But FANTASTIC is not.

Perhaps it's "DC Comics characters": FREEZE, but MIME no.

Let's try a different approach: Cluster the words.

Cluster 1: LAG, DROP, FREEZE - gaming/computer problems (lag, frame drop, freeze).

Need fourth. Perhaps ECHO? Echo as audio lag or something? Weak.

Cluster 2: MIME, ECHO - imitation/sound repeat.

Cluster 3: SAILOR, SAMURAI - warriors/fighters from different cultures.

With REFEREE? No.

SAILOR, SAMURAI, REFEREE, and ? Fighters? PRISONER no.

Cluster 4: FANTASTIC, APOLLO, PRISONER, CANDLES - no obvious.

CANDLES - Roman CANDLES (firework), but no.

Prisoner, perhaps "Birdman of Alcatraz" no.

Another idea: "Outkast songs" or something? No.

Perhaps "Pixar movies": No.

Wait, FANTASTIC Mr. Fox? No.

Let's consider if there's a group for "moon-related":

SAILOR MOON, APOLLO (moon landings), and perhaps "drop" moon drop? No.

"echo" moon echo? No.

PRISONER of the moon? No.

Blue moon, paper moon no.

Perhaps "Sailor Moon villains" no.

Perhaps the imitation group is MIME, PARROT gone, but perhaps MIME, MONKEY gone, ECHO, and "ape" no.

Since incorrect, maybe it's "animals that imitate": but only parrot, monkey gone.

No.

Let's try to guess the imitation without the Aladdin ones.

So perhaps the imitation is ECHO, MIME, and two others? Like "drop" as echo drop no.

Perhaps a different category altogether.

Let's look for homophones or something. Lag (beer), no.

Perhaps "types of frames": FREEZE frame, DROP frame, LAG frame, and ? 

Fourth could be "mime" no.

Or "key frame" no.

Gaming: lag, freeze, drop, and "crash" no, but perhaps "prisoner" no.

Perhaps the fourth is "mime" ? No.

Let's see if there's "connection problems": LAG, DROP, FREEZE (hang/freeze), and ECHO (bad connection echo).

Echo in calls when connection bad.

Yes! Bad video call issues: LAG, FREEZE, DROP (call drop), ECHO.

Perfect Connections category: "Video call problems" or "Zoom mishaps": LAG, FREEZE, ECHO, DROP.

Yes! ECHO was in previous guess but wrong group, DROP fits perfectly.

High confidence, makes sense why previous imitation was incorrect - ECHO is here instead.

Yes!</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now 8 words left, need next group of 4.

Potential categories:

Strong group: Mr. ___ characters: FANTASTIC (Mr. Fantastic), MIME (Mr. Mime from Pokémon), REFEREE? No. Wait, FREEZE gone (Mr. Freeze). Only 2 now.

FANTASTIC, MIME... not enough.

Another: Moon-related: SAILOR (Sailor Moon), APOLLO (Apollo moon missions). Need two more. CANDLES (candlelight vigil? No). Weak.

Costumes/performers: MIME, REFEREE (referee outfit), SAILOR (sailor suit), SAMURAI (samurai costume). All common costume party or Halloween staples. Possible, but medium confidence.

Movies: The Last SAMURAI, APOLLO 13, The PRISONER (of Zenda/Azkaban), FANTASTIC Four/Beasts. All titles starting with "The" + adjective/noun + number/theme? Weak.

"Numbered sequels/entries": FANTASTIC Four, APOLLO 13, Sixteen CANDLES, Harry Potter and the PRISONER of Azkaban (3rd). That's exact! All famous movie/book titles with numbers:

- Fantastic Four

- Apollo 13

- Sixteen Candles

- Prisoner [of Azkaban, the third Harry Potter]

Perfect Connections-style category: "Movies with numbers in the title" or specifically these iconic ones.

Remaining words same: SAMURAI, MIME, SAILOR, FANTASTIC, CANDLES, PRISONER, REFEREE, APOLLO.

Numbered titles was plausible but wrong. Reassess.

Strong new group: Mr. ___ characters/villains: FANTASTIC (Mr. Fantastic, Marvel), MIME (Mr. Mime, Pokémon), and since FREEZE gone, need two more? Wait, only two clear. APOLLO? No. Weak.

Moon-related: SAILOR MOON, APOLLO (moon landing program), and perhaps others? CANDLES (moon candles? No). Only two.

Costumes/performers: MIME (performer), REFEREE (striped outfit), SAILOR (sailor suit), SAMURAI (iconic warrior costume). Common in dress-up, Halloween, or Village People vibe (SAILOR is direct). Connections often does "seen at a costume party" or "iconic outfits."

Birthday-related: CANDLES (birthday candles), but others? FANTASTIC (party), no.

Prisoner, Apollo - space prison? No.

TV shows: The PRISONER, APOLLO (no), FANTASTIC Voyage? No.

"Fantastic" group: No.

Stronger: Striped-shirt wearers: MIME (classic black/white stripes), REFEREE (black/white stripes), SAILOR (often striped sailor suit), and ? SAMURAI no, CANDLES no.

SAILOR suits frequently striped, yes. But fourth? Perhaps only three.

REFEREE, MIME, SAILOR... and PRISONER (prisoner uniform sometimes striped).

Yes! Classic striped uniforms: PRISONER (old-timey black/white stripes), REFEREE (stripes), MIME (striped shirt), SAILOR (breton stripes).

Perfect! Iconic "striped outfit wearers." Fits Connections visual/theme category.

Exactly 4 left. Must be the final group.

What connects them? Likely "The ___ Four" or similar phrases:
- FANTASTIC Four (Marvel superhero team)
- APOLLO Four Forty (band, but more relevantly, Apollo 4 was a mission, but wait)
Actually, precise: "The Four ___" no.

Better: Famous quartets/groups of four:
But specifically, movie titles: Fantastic Four, Apollo 13 (not four), Sixteen Candles (16, not four), Last Samurai (not).

Previous numbered was incorrect, but perhaps "The Last Samurai", no.

Another: All can precede "Jack" or something? No.

Think: "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" - but APOLLOcalypse? Close, but no.

Band names: The Fantastic Four, Apollo 440 (Apollo Four Forty), Four Candles (sketch), Four Samurai? No.

Classic: The "Four Candles" is a famous comedy sketch (fork handles/four candles homophone).

But perhaps: All are titles with numbers:
Fantastic FOUR, APOLLO 13? But 13≠4, Sixteen CANDLES (16), Seven SAMURAI.

Yes! Movies known for their numbers:
- Seven Samurai
- Fantastic Four
- Sixteen Candles
- Apollo 13

That was close to my earlier guess, but earlier had PRISONER instead of SAMURAI. Prisoner was 3rd HP, but Seven Samurai fits perfectly as numbered ensemble cast movie or iconic numbered titles.

Since it's the last four, and incorrect guesses were partial, this must be it: "Movies with numbers in their titles."

High confidence as final group.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Look for clear categories. Notice Christmas/holiday decorations: CANDY CANE (striped holiday candy), STRING LIGHTS (holiday lights), TINSEL (shiny garland), ANGEL (tree topper).

These four are strongly connected as Christmas tree or holiday decorations. No overlaps with other words.

Other potentials: Image editing - PHOTOSHOP, AIRBRUSH, TOUCH UP, FIX (all relate to editing photos or fixing images). French words - CORNICHON, PAMPLEMOUSSE, VINAIGRETTE (pickles, grapefruit, dressing). Hexagonal patterns - HONEYCOMB, SOLAR PANEL, SPREADSHEET (cells), ORGANISM (some like bees).

Other remaining: Hexagonal structures - HONEYCOMB, SOLAR PANEL, SPREADSHEET (grid mimics hex), ORGANISM (biological like beehive). That's solid too, but French group is more precise and wordplay-heavy (PAIN as "bread" in French).

This is a classic Connections-style visual/pattern category.

All iconic 1980s launches: MTV (music channel), VHS (home video standard), NES (gaming console), ALF (alien sitcom). Tight thematic fit for "1980s phenomena" or "80s media icons."

This is a tight category (synonyms for unite). Explains why previous guess failed – split BOND and WED incorrectly, and FLOWER/DAY don't fit here.

(Removed BOXER, BRIEF, THONG, HIPSTER)

Next clear category: Music genres/subcultures/styles.
- PUNK (punk rock)
- BOHEMIAN (Bohemian Rhapsody / bohemian style)
- FLAPPER (1920s flapper style/music era)
- HIPSTER was removed, but BOHEMIAN, PUNK, FLAPPER, and perhaps another? Wait, better: Youth subcultures/fashion styles: PUNK, FLAPPER, BOHEMIAN, HIPSTER—but HIPSTER gone.

Stronger: Famous rock songs.
- BOHEMIAN (Rhapsody - Queen)
- STAIRWAY (to Heaven - Led Zeppelin)
- HOTEL (California - Eagles)
- CHAIN? (Chain of Fools? Or Hotel Chain? No.)

CHAIN of Fools (Aretha Franklin), but that's a stretch. Actually, solid rock classics: Bohemian Rhapsody, Stairway to Heaven, Hotel California... what's fourth? Perhaps not.

Prank synonyms: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL... needs fourth. Maybe HANDLE? No.

BABA might be Ali Baba, but with PRANK, TRICK, FOOL? Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves – trickster tale.

Float, Chain, Handle – weak.

Best group: Trickery/april fools: PRANK, FOOL, TRICK... and BABA? Baba as fool? Or FLAPPER no.

FLAPPER is a style, but let's think music.

Queen songs: BOHEMIAN Rhapsody, but others? No.

Prominent rock songs: 
- Bohemian Rhapsody
- Stairway to Heaven
- Hotel California
- And CHAIN? No, perhaps not.

Another idea: Words that pair with "fool": April FOOL, play the FOOL, but PRANK, TRICK.

Let's try subcultures: PUNK, FLAPPER, BOHEMIAN, HIPSTER—but HIPSTER gone. BOHEMIAN and HIPSTER similar, but gone.

BOHEMIAN, PUNK, FLAPPER... what's fourth? Perhaps not.

Look for another: Types of parades or something? FLOAT, but no.

HANDLE – Twitter handle, but no.

Perhaps: Queen songs aren't, but famous songs:
Actually, upon reflection, the rock anthems seem strong, but fourth?

CHAIN – perhaps "Chain Lightning" or no.

Perhaps the prank one needs a fourth: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, and... perhaps BABA as "baba" like fool in some languages? Weak.

BABA – Rum Baba, but no.

Another category: Parts of a bicycle? CHAIN, HANDLE (handlebar), but no.

Let's prioritize prankster terms: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL... and FLAPPER? No.

FOOL, PRANK, TRICK – only 3.

Perhaps "April ___": but only FOOL.

New idea: Classic rock songs:
- Bohemian Rhapsody
- Stairway to Heaven
- Hotel California
- And "Float On" by Modest Mouse, but FLOAT.

Weak.

Perhaps the subculture one is PUNK, FLAPPER, BOHEMIAN, and... PUNK, FLAPPER are 20s rebel, punk 70s, bohemian.

What's fourth? Perhaps it's PUNK, HIPSTER gone, but maybe BOHEMIAN, PUNK, FLAPPER, and... no fourth obvious.

Let's list potential:
Another group: BOXER gone, but underwear was first.

Perhaps dessert: FLOAT (root beer float), BABA (rum baba), but what else? No.

BABA, FLOAT – parade float, but no.

Let's think differently. Common category in Connections: Song with "to heaven" stairway, but.

I recall Connections often has music titles.

BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, HOTEL CALIFORNIA, and... for fourth, perhaps CHAIN? No.

What's a fourth famous song? Perhaps "Fool on the Hill" for FOOL, but no.

Perhaps it's the prank group, but needs 4.

PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, and... HANDLE? No.

"Practical joke" synonyms: PRANK, GAG? No.

TRICK, PRANK, FOOL, and perhaps BOXER gone.

Perhaps it's "April Fools' pranks": but.

Let's try to find 4 that fit perfectly.

Look at BABA, perhaps "Ali ___": Ali Baba, but others Ali Chain? No.

Another: Underwear was good, now perhaps music styles: PUNK, BOHEMIAN (boho), FLAPPER (jazz age), HIPSTER gone.

Perhaps it's 4: PUNK, BOHEMIAN, FLAPPER, and... no fourth.

CHAIN, THONG gone, but chain as jewelry? No.

Perhaps door parts or something? HANDLE, but no.

FLOAT, PARADE FLOAT, but no.

Let's search for connections.

Perhaps "swimsuit/underwear" was first, now "Led Zeppelin songs" or something.

Stairway to Heaven is Led Zep, Bohemian Queen, Hotel Eagles.

All are iconic songs from 70s rock albums.

But what's fourth? Perhaps "Killer Queen" no.

Perhaps the category is "songs with one-word titles that are longer": no.

Perhaps it's "_____ to Heaven": only STAIRWAY.

Perhaps another group: BOXER was underwear, now perhaps fighting styles: BOXER gone, but PUNK? No.

Let's try to group prank: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL... and BABA? In some contexts, "old baba" no.

Perhaps "fool" synonyms: FOOL, TRICK, PRANK, and... DUPE? No.

Perhaps include "FLAPPER" as in flapper like trick? No.

FLAPPER is a 20s woman, known for wild behavior, but.

Let's think of "rumba" no.

BABA – Baba O'Riley by The Who, which is a rock song!

Yes! Baba O'Riley (The Who), Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen), Stairway to Heaven (Led Zeppelin), Hotel California (Eagles).

All iconic 70s rock songs!

Perfect match: BABA, BOHEMIAN, STAIRWAY, HOTEL.

That fits exactly – shortened song titles.

BABA (O'Riley), BOHEMIAN (Rhapsody), STAIRWAY (to Heaven), HOTEL (California).

Yes, classic Connections category: First words of famous songs.

High confidence.

Confirm: Baba O'Riley, Bohemian Rhapsody, Stairway to Heaven, Hotel California. All legendary rock tracks.

Great!

So guess that.

Other groups can wait, like pranks: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL... perhaps later with fourth.

Yes.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Now 8 words left, need two more groups of 4.

Clear category: Synonyms for joke or deception.
- PRANK
- TRICK
- FOOL (as in fool someone)
- FLAPPER? No, flapper doesn't fit. Wait, only 3 strong ones.

FLAPPER no. Perhaps prank-related: but need exactly 4.

Another: Youth counterculture movements/styles.
- PUNK (1970s punk rockers)
- FLAPPER (1920s flappers)
- HIPSTER gone, BOHEMIAN gone.
Only 2.

Remaining: PRANK, CHAIN, PUNK, HANDLE, FLOAT, FLAPPER, TRICK, FOOL.

Prankster actions: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, and... perhaps PUNK as in punk'd (pranked)? But stretch.

April Fools' related: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL... still 3.

Other category: Types of parties or something? No.

HANDLE, CHAIN, FLOAT, FLAPPER.

FLOAT (parade float), but flapper?

Perhaps Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade elements? FLOAT... no.

CHAIN, HANDLE... like chain handle? No.

PUNK, FLAPPER... music genres? Punk rock, flapper era jazz.

But with what?

Stronger: Words that can precede "or treat": TRICK or treat, but only one.

Synonyms for deceive: TRICK, FOOL, but prank yes, chain no.

Perhaps the prank group is PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, PUNK – as in "punk'd" TV show about pranks.

But weak.

Let's think: FOOL, PRANK, TRICK... and HANDLE? No.

Another idea: "Pull a ___": pull a PRANK, pull a FAST ONE but no, pull a TRICK? Sort of.

Perhaps it's drag queen terms or something? No.

FLAPPER as in old term for young woman, but.

New: Perhaps "bicycle parts": CHAIN (bike chain), HANDLE (handlebars), but what's else? No pedals etc.

FLOAT no.

Perhaps "root beer ___": FLOAT, but only one.

Let's pair differently.

Notice: CHAIN, PUNK... punk chain? No.

Perhaps music genres: PUNK, FLAPPER? No.

FLAPPER relates to 1920s, PUNK to 1970s.

Perhaps the group is PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, FLAPPER? Why flapper? Flappers were mischievous? Weak.

Look up common connections: in Connections, often "fool around" but.

Another: "Practical ___": practical joke=PRANK, practical TRICK? No.

Perhaps the category is "jester's actions": FOOL is jester, PRANK, TRICK.

Still 3.

Remaining words suggest two groups.

One group: PRANK, FOOL, TRICK, FLAPPER? No.

FLAPPER might be a type of fool or something? No.

Let's see: perhaps "April Fools' ___": but no.

Different category: Things you do on April 1st: PRANK, FOOL, TRICK someone.

Still 3.

Perhaps the fourth is PUNK, as in to punk someone = to prank.

Yes, "punk" as a verb means to trick or hoax, archaic but exists, and popularized by Punk'd.

But confidence medium.

Other group in remaining would be CHAIN, HANDLE, FLOAT, FLAPPER – what connects them?

HANDLE – door handle, chain – door chain, float – ? Flapper – door flapper? No.

FLOAT – toilet float, but no.

Perhaps retail: BIG BOXER gone, CHAIN (chain store), but no.

Perhaps cocktail types: FLAPPER? No.

FLOAT (root beer float), but baba was dessert, gone.

Let's think of "parade": FLOAT (parade float), but what else? No marchers.

CHAIN GANG? No.

HANDLE, as in name/handle, no.

Perhaps "Instagram-famous dogs" or something? No.

New insight: Perhaps "bikini parts" or no, thong gone.

Perhaps the subculture one now with remaining: PUNK, FLAPPER, and ? Only 2.

Perhaps one group is the pranks: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL... need fourth.

Let's assume the prank group is PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, and PUNK (as in punk someone = trick).

Then the other would be CHAIN, HANDLE, FLOAT, FLAPPER.

What connects those? Hmm.

FLAPPER – a type of fish or something? No.

FLAPPER – lipstick flapper? No.

Another idea: All can be hairstyles or something? Punk (mohawk punk), flapper (flapper hair), but chain? No.

Perhaps "swimming strokes" or no.

Let's try to search my knowledge for Connections-like.

Perhaps "door ___": door HANDLE, door CHAIN (security chain), door FLAPPER? No, damper.

No.

FLOAT for door float? No.

Perhaps Macy's parade: FLOAT, but also giant balloons of characters like FOOL? No.

Let's try different grouping.

Perhaps "rapper aliases" or something? No.

PUNK, FOOL – music? Sex Pistols punk, Fool's Garden? No.

Perhaps the category is "play ___": play TRICK, play FOOL? Play PRANK no, play PUNK no.

"Card ___": card TRICK, card SHARP no.

Perhaps it's "kind of saw": CHAINsaw, but handle saw? No.

CHAIN saw, HAND saw (handle? Hand-held), but float saw? No.

Close: Types of saws: chain, hand (HANDLE as hand-le?), coping? No.

Not.

Let's look at FLOAT, FLAPPER, PUNK, FOOL.

No.

Perhaps "vintage fashion styles": FLAPPER, PUNK, BOHEMIAN gone, HIPSTER gone.

Still 2.

I need to pick the strongest.

The prank synonyms are the strongest: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL... but fourth?

Upon thinking, "prank" "trick" "fool" and "gag" but no gag.

Perhaps "hoax" no.

Perhaps it's PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, and HANDLE – as in "handle" like fly off the handle? No.

Another: "Dirty rotten scoundrels" no.

Let's consider "fool" as in court jester, and FLAPPER as loose woman, no.

Perhaps the group is words that mean "deceive": TRICK, FOOL, PUNK, CON but no.

"Punk" does mean to trick: yes, dictionary: punk (v.) - to trick or fool.

Yes, though rare.

But perhaps better: looking at remaining, the other group might be CHAIN, BOXER gone, but no.

Underwear was boxer, brief, thong, hipster.

Now perhaps fight wear or no.

Perhaps "parade": FLOAT, but also MARCH but no.

Let's try to find 4 that fit.

New idea: "Twitter ___": HANDLE (username), but what else? No blue check etc.

Only one.

CHAIN letter, but no.

Perhaps "supply ___": supply CHAIN, supply HANDLE? No.

I think the prank group is PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, PUNK – all ways to deceive or joke on someone.

PUNK as verb or as in being punked = pranked.

Yes, and Punk'd is a famous prank show.

Perfect for Connections-style wordplay.

Then the last group would be CHAIN, HANDLE, FLOAT, FLAPPER.

What is that? Let's see if it fits something.

FLAPPER: loose 1920s woman.

CHAIN: chain-smoker? No.

FLOAT: soda float.

HANDLE: mustache handlebar? Handlebar mustache.

CHAIN: ? 

FLOAT: loan float? No.

Perhaps barber shop styles or something? No.

Perhaps "vape terms" no.

Another thought: All can be types of "parties": chain party? No, float party no.

Perhaps it's not that.

Reverse: perhaps the subculture group is PUNK, FLAPPER, and wait, with what? Only 2.

Unless PRANK is prankster style no.

Perhaps the groups are different.

Let's list all possible.

Idea: "Root beer ___": FLOAT, but only one.

"Boxer" gone.

Another: "April ___": April FOOL, but only one.

Perhaps "fool's ___": fool's errand, but no.

Let's think music again: PUNK rock, FLAPPER era, but TRICK pony? No.

"one-trick pony".

CHAIN gang (song), FOOL (song), but.

Perhaps the category is "brass ____": brass HANDLE? No.

Let's try to google in mind: common NYT Connections with these words.

Since previous were underwear and song titles, likely the next is synonyms for mischief: PRANK, TRICK, FOOL... fourth?

Looking online in my knowledge: actually, "prank" "trick" "hoax" "gag", but gag not here.

Perhaps include "float" as in check float fraud, trick.

Weak.

FLOAT as in parade prank float? No.

Let's see CHAIN, HANDLE.

Perhaps "bikini atoll" no.

Perhaps "types of underwear" was first, "rock songs" second, now "youth subcultures": but with what 4? PUNK, FLAPPER... only 2 left.

Hipster, bohemian gone.

Bohemian was in songs.

Perhaps it's "famous punk bands" no.

Let's try to group CHAIN, THONG gone, but chain and thong are underwear too? Chain mail underwear? No.

Thong was underwear, chain is not.

Another idea: "Flip-flop varieties": THONG gone, FLIP FLOP, but flapper no.

FLAPPER sounds like flipper, but no.

FLAPPER, FLIPPER close but no.

Perhaps the group is types of shorts or something? No.

Let's think of "fool": King Lear's fool, but no.

Perhaps the prank group is 4: PRANK, GAG no, but TRICK, PRANK, FOOL, and... "jape" no.

Perhaps it's PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, and "josh" no.

Perhaps it's "play a ___ on": play a TRICK on, play a PRANK on, fool, punk.

Yes.

I think it's safe to go with PRANK, FOOL, TRICK, PUNK as "ways to deceive someone" or "prank".

High confidence because the other possible is weak, and in Connections, wordplay like "punk" as verb is common.

Confirm: yes, Merriam-Webster: punk transitive verb: to make a fool of : dupe.

Perfect.

So guess: PRANK, PUNK, FOOL, TRICK.

Yes.

Then last will be CHAIN, HANDLE, FLOAT, FLAPPER.

What could that be? Perhaps "door ___": door handle, door chain, door flap (flapper?), float no.

Or "old-timey insult for a young woman": FLAPPER, but others no.

Perhaps "swimwear styles": FLAPPER? Vintage swimsuits called flappers? No.

Upon second thought, maybe switch.

Is there a better group?

Sudden insight: "Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade features": FLOAT (floats), but also BALLOONS, MARCHING BANDS, but words: FLOAT, and perhaps CLOTHIER no.

No.

Another: "bicycle parts": CHAIN, HANDLEbar (HANDLE), PEDAL no, FLOAT no.

No.

"Parts of a gun": trigger, handle, chain? No.

Perhaps the other group is words that can mean "manage": HANDLE, but chain manage no.

No.

Perhaps "flapper" as in duck flapper or hunting, no.

Perhaps "kinds of salads" no.

Stick with the prank group, as it's the clearest 4.

Yes, PRANK, TRICK, FOOL, PUNK – all mean to deceive or joke maliciously/funnily.

Perfect.

Connections: These are all types of door fixtures or security/door-related items.
- DOOR HANDLE
- DOOR CHAIN (security chain)
- DOOR FLAPPER (also called door flap or automatic door closer flap)
- FLOAT? Wait, float doesn't fit door.

Alternative: Perhaps "vintage door hardware" but float no.

Re-think: FLAPPER as in "flapper valve" or something, but.

Better: All can precede "mail":
No, chain mail, but handle mail? No.

Perhaps barber/mustache styles: HANDLEbar (mustache), CHAIN? No.

FLOAT: root beer float.

No.

Perhaps "old-fashioned swimsuit styles": FLAPPER (1920s bathing suit style sometimes called), but thong was underwear.

No.

Upon reflection: "Door closers and security":
But float?

Toilet FLOAT (in tank), but others not plumbing.

HANDLE (faucet handle), CHAIN (toilet chain), FLAPPER (toilet flapper valve), FLOAT (toilet float).

Yes! Perfect match: Parts of a toilet tank/flush mechanism.
- FLOAT (ball float that regulates water level)
- FLAPPER (rubber seal that opens/closes for flush)
- CHAIN (connects flapper to flush handle)
- HANDLE (flush handle/lever)

Exact fit! Classic Connections-style "toilet parts" category, hidden in plain sight.

One clear group: Words/phrases with "WOOD": WOODEN, WOODY, WOODSTOCK, WOODCHUCK. (WOODEN = made of wood; WOODY = like Woody Allen or wood-like; WOODSTOCK = festival or bird; WOODCHUCK = animal.)

WOODSTOCK is a music festival but fits "wood" theme; WOODCHUCK directly.

Another potential: Stiff/awkward speech: AWKWARD, STILTED, STIFF, WOODEN. (All synonyms for clumsy or unnatural, especially "wooden" as stiff acting.)

That's a strong category: "STILTED" means awkwardly formal; "WOODEN" means stiff; "STIFF" and "AWKWARD."

This seems like a classic Connections-style category: synonyms for awkward/stiff.

Other groups: Foghorn Leghorn (FOGHORN), Woodie Guthrie (WOODY, GUTHRIE? Wait, it's Woody Guthrie), Woodstock festival, Chuck Wood? No.

Scrooge, Classics? No.

Woodchuck chuck wood tongue twister: WOODCHUCK, CHUCK, WOOD. But needs 4th.

The stiff/awkward one is solid: AWKWARD, STILTED, STIFF, WOODEN.

All describe unnatural delivery or movement.

Yes, high confidence.

Alternative wood theme less tight because WOODY is adjective/name, WOODSTOCK stretches.

Woodstock is the bird from Peanuts.

Foghorn Leghorn: FOGHORN.

Chuck Wood? No.

Now, clear group: Names of famous figures: WOODY GUTHRIE (folk singer), FOGHORN LEGHORN (cartoon rooster), WOODSTOCK (Peanuts character, Snoopy's bird friend), SCROOGE MC DUCK (Disney character, often just Scrooge).

These are all iconic fictional/cartoon characters or real with nicknames: but specifically, all are classic animated/cartoon characters except Guthrie is real, wait no.

Woody Guthrie is real folk singer.

Alternative: Music festivals? WOODSTOCK, but others no.

CLASSICS might be category.

CREATE, THEREFORE — philosophical? Cogito ergo sum is "I think therefore I am" — no.

Perhaps Woody Guthrie, Foghorn Leghorn, Scrooge McDuck, Woodstock (Peanuts).

Yes: All cartoon/fictional characters with "wood"/sound-alike names? But Guthrie not.

FOGHORN Leghorn, WOODY Woodpecker? But WOODY is listed, not Woodpecker.

WOODY (Woodpecker), FOGHORN (Leghorn), WOODSTOCK (Peanuts bird), SCROOGE (McDuck).

Yes! All are famous cartoon characters:

- WOODY: Woody Woodpecker

- FOGHORN: Foghorn Leghorn

- WOODSTOCK: Snoopy's bird friend in Peanuts

- SCROOGE: Scrooge McDuck

Remaining words: CLASSICS, GUTHRIE, CREATE, THEREFORE.

These form a clear category based on Woody Guthrie's famous song "This Land Is Your Land," which has the repeated lyric: "This land was made for you and me." However, the connection is through philosophical/logical phrases or song inspirations, but more precisely:

- CREATE (ex nihilo? No.)
Wait, better: These are words that complete famous phrases:

Actually, spotting the pattern: "WOODY GUTHRIE CLASSICS" isn't direct.

GUTHRIE (Woody Guthrie classics), but no.

CREATE, THEREFORE — "I think, therefore I am" but that's "cogito ergo sum."

Perhaps: Words that can precede "CLASSICS": GUTHRIE CLASSICS? No.

Standard Connections: These might be words that form a logical sequence or brand.

Final connection: "CREATE" as in Adobe Create? No.

Looking precisely: The remaining are likely a category like "Woody Guthrie song titles" or something, but no.

CLASSICS, GUTHRIE — perhaps music labels or something.

Actually, upon reflection: "THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND" by Woody Guthrie, but words don't match.

Perhaps they are all words that can be followed by "or": No.

Strongest: These are words from the phrase "To create is to therefore classics" — no.

Perhaps it's "logic words": CREATE (generate), THEREFORE (conclusion), but only 4.

All 4: Perhaps "Woody Guthrie classics include 'This Land...'" but that's stretch.

Since it's the last 4, they must connect.

Another idea: "CREATE A CLASSICS GUTHRIE THEREFORE" — no.

Perhaps philosophical: "CREATE" (make), "THEREFORE" (ergo), "CLASSICS" (Greek classics), GUTHRIE (Arlo?).

I think the category is "words that can follow 'greatest' " or something, but no.

Perhaps it's a rebus or direct: But in Connections style, likely "Woody Guthrie classics" but that's not.

GUTHRIE is Woody Guthrie, and CLASSICS refers to his songs, but needs 4.

Since previous were precise first-name style, this might be something else.

Remaining: CLASSICS, GUTHRIE, CREATE, THEREFORE.

Possible category: Things associated with logic/philosophy? THEREFORE (logic term), CREATE (create argument?), no.

Perhaps song titles or lyrics.

Woody Guthrie song: "So Long (It's Been Good to Know Yuh)" etc., no.

Perhaps it's "words that rhyme" or no.

Let's think differently: "CREATE" sounds like "crate", no.

Perhaps "Ergo" connections: THEREFORE = ergo, and "cogito ergo sum" but "I CREATE therefore" no.

Perhaps the category is "_____ or": CREATE OR perish? No.

Standard: I recall some Connections have "latin words" or something.

CLASSICS (as in classic literature), but.

Perhaps they are all words that can be verbs or nouns, but that's weak.

High confidence guess anyway as the last 4 must be a group: Likely "Woody Guthrie classics" but how?

GUTHRIE's "classics", but CREATE and THEREFORE.

Look at "CREATE": Perhaps "proCREATE", no.

Another: "De gustibus non est disputandum" no.

Perhaps it's "logic puzzle words" or no.

Final logic: Since it's the last group, guess them all. But need category.

Upon second thought: "This Land" lyrics have "from California to the New York island", no.

Perhaps CREATE is "make", THEREFORE "thus", CLASSICS "timeless works", GUTHRIE "singer".

Weak.

Perhaps a different grouping earlier? No, previous were correct.

The puzzle has 4 groups of 4, this is the 4th group.

To find the connection: Let's search patterns.

CLASSICS, CREATE — like "classics create"? No.

THEREFORE, CREATE — "I create, therefore I am" parody of Descartes.

But with GUTHRIE, CLASSICS.

Perhaps "famous albums" or no.

GUTHRIE, CLASSICS — "American Folk Classics" or something.

I think the category is "words that complete 'woody _____' " but woody classics? No.

Woody Guthrie, but already used Woody.

Perhaps it's "songwriters" no.

Let's try to think of categories.

Possible category: Terms in logic: CREATE (hypothesis?), THEREFORE (conclusion), but CLASSICS no.

Perhaps they are all 8-letter words? No.

CLASSICS (7), GUTHRIE (7), CREATE (6), THEREFORE (9). No.

Perhaps "palindromic" no.

Another idea: Perhaps "connect with 'woody'" but no.

Since the puzzle is themed around Woody/wood, this group is Woody Guthrie classics, but what are the 4?

Perhaps the category is "New York Times ___": New York Times Classics? No.

The AI is NYT Connections expert.

Typical category: "make": CREATE, but no.

Let's reason: "THEREFORE" is "ergo", "CREATE" is "make", "CLASSICS" is "oldies", "GUTHRIE" is "folk singer".

Perhaps "Arlo Guthrie" but listed as GUTHRIE.

I think the connection is "famous folkie's output" no.

Perhaps it's "words in a famous quote".

Let's try to see: "We must therefore create" or something.

Perhaps it's "latin-derived words" or no.

Perhaps the category is "Seven-letter words" but CREATE is 6.

CLASSICS 8? C-L-A-S-S-I-C-S =8, G-U-T-H-R-I-E=7, C-R-E-A-T-E=6, T-H-E-R-E-F-O-R-E=9. No.

Perhaps it's "can be preceded by 'folk' ": Folk classics, folk guthrie (Woody), but folk create? Folk therefore? No.

'Folk classics', 'Woody Guthrie', but still.

Perhaps the category is completely different: "synonyms for 'make'"? CREATE, but others no.

CREATE = make, but THEREFORE no.

Perhaps "conjunctions" no.

Let's think step-by-step again.

Since it's the last 4, and the response format requires a guess, and in Connections, the last one is obvious once others are gone.

The connection must be something like "things with multiple meanings" but that's not specific.

Let's look for common category.

Upon thinking: "CREATE" and "THEREFORE" might be from "I am, therefore I create" no.

Perhaps it's "Descartes in other words": "I think, THEREFORE I am" but "cogito" is think/create? No.

Perhaps the category is "Woody Guthrie song words" but let's assume it's a group of "music-related": CLASSICS (classical music), GUTHRIE (singer), but CREATE (create music), THEREFORE (therefore music? No).

Weak.

Another: Perhaps "brand names" or no.

CREATE is a command in programming, THEREFORE is logic, CLASSICS is car class, GUTHRIE is street or something.

This is taking too long.

Since high confidence in previous, this must be the group, and the category is likely "Woody Guthrie classics" but that's not 4 words.

No, the guess is the 4 words.

I have to guess these 4 as the last group.

Yes, so guess CLASSICS, GUTHRIE, CREATE, THEREFORE.

What is the category? Perhaps "words that can follow 'American' ": American CLASSICS, American GUTHRIE? No.

American CREATE? No.

Perhaps "proverbs" or no.

Look: "CREATE" "or" "destroy", no.

Perhaps it's " ergo " related: THEREFORE = ergo, and "video ergo sum" no.

Perhaps the category is "____ classics": GUTHRIE classics? No.

Perhaps it's "terms from philosophy": THEREFORE (deduction), CREATE (as in divine create), CLASSICS (classical philosophy), GUTHRIE (no).

Guthrie is out of place, but since Woody was used separately, GUTHRIE is part of Woody Guthrie, but category is perhaps "last names of folk singers" no.

Perhaps the category is "New Yorker cartoonists" no.

Let's try to google in mind: Is there a connection between these words?

Perhaps "CREATE" is from Minecraft or something, no.

Perhaps it's "words with double letters": CLASSICS (SS), GUTHRIE (no double), G U T H R I E - no doubles, CREATE (no), THEREFORE (EE).

No.

CLASSICS has SS, THEREFORE has EE, CREATE has none, GUTHRIE has none.

No.

Perhaps the category is "logical operators" or no.

I think I got it: The category is "Latin phrases words" or something.

No.

Perhaps it's "fill in the blank: 'All ___ is _____ ' " no.

Perhaps it's "song title words from Guthrie": Looking up in mind, Woody Guthrie songs: "Pastures of Plenty", "Do Re Mi", "Dust Bowl", no.

One song is "I Ain't Got No Home", no.

Another: "New York Town", no.

Perhaps not.

Perhaps the category is "words that can be followed by 'or' ": CREATE OR, but no.

CREATE or destroy, live or die, no.

Perhaps it's "conclusion words": THEREFORE, but no.

Perhaps the group is a rebus for "classics create therefore Guthrie" no.

Since it's Connections, categories are usually straightforward like "seen in a philosophy class" or something.

Philosophy: THEREFORE (logic), CLASSICS (classical philosophy), CREATE (as in ex nihilo from classics), but GUTHRIE no.

Guthrie doesn't fit.

Perhaps GUTHRIE is Arlo Guthrie, who sang "Alice's Restaurant", which is a classic, but stretch.

Perhaps the theme is "fog horn" etc., but already done.

I have to make the guess as the remaining 4.

Confidence high because it's the last group.

Yes.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

These four remain. Connections:
- HERO and SUB were sandwiches, but SUB used; HERO stands alone but fits with others thematically?
- SOMEDAY, FANTASY: aspirational, dreamy concepts.
- HONEY: term of endearment or sweet.
- Strong link: Words that complete "____, I Shrunk the Kids" – but no.

- Upon reflection: HONEY (term of endearment), HERO (my hero), SOMEDAY (someday we'll...), FANTASY (my fantasy). But solid as the last group.

2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. If invalid, you'll see available words and what went wrong.
5. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 mistakes allowed).

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Provide your response in this exact structure:

[Your step-by-step reasoning process. Analyze the words, identify potential categories, consider connections, and explain your logic for the guess you're making.]
&lt;/thinking&gt;

&lt;guess&gt;
[EXACTLY four words, ALL CAPS, comma-separated]
&lt;/guess&gt;

Identify potential categories:

1. Nonsense words (common Connections category): BALONEY, BULL, BUNK, RUBBISH. These all mean nonsense or rubbish (e.g., "That's baloney!", "bullshit", "bunk", "rubbish").

2. Other potentials: 
   - Surnames of fictional spies: CRANK (Crank Yankers? No), PEEL (Emma Peel from Avengers), POWERS (Austin Powers), ARCHER (Sterling Archer), HUNT (Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible). That's four: ARCHER, HUNT, PEEL, POWERS.
   - WALK, RAISE, HIKE, NAP: Could be "increase" (hike up prices, raise, walk up? No) or "outing" (hike, walk), but weak.
   - JACK, TAIL, FISH: Actions like jack up, tail someone, fish for compliments—but need fourth.
   - CRANK, JACK: Could be lifting devices, but incomplete.

Strongest category is nonsense synonyms: BALONEY, BULL, BUNK, RUBBISH. These fit perfectly as slang for nonsense. The spy surnames are also plausible but slightly more obscure (fictional spies). Start with the most straightforward linguistic category.

Logic for guess: BALONEY, BULL, BUNK, RUBBISH. High confidence due to direct semantic match.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

With nonsense group removed, next strongest category: Surnames of fictional spies/agents: ARCHER (Sterling Archer from Archer), HUNT (Ethan Hunt from Mission: Impossible), PEEL (Emma Peel from The Avengers), POWERS (Austin Powers). This is a classic pop culture Connections-style group, all iconic spy characters' last names.

Other potentials:
- Hike, walk, nap: Leisure activities? But need fourth (tail? No).
- Raise, crank, jack, hike: All mean "increase" (raise prices, crank up volume, jack up prices, hike up prices). That's also strong!
- Fish, tail, hunt: Pursue (fish for info, tail someone, hunt). But weaker fourth.

Spy surnames seem more precise and thematic. Raise/crank/jack/hike is viable alternative, but spies fit better for Connections' clever pop culture links. Go with spies.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Clear category emerging: Words that mean "increase": JACK (jack up prices), RAISE (raise prices), CRANK (crank up the volume), HIKE (hike up prices/fees). This is a strong semantic group, common in Connections for verbs with dual meanings related to intensification or elevation.

Remaining words: WALK, TAIL, FISH, NAP don't fit this cleanly as increases.

Other possibilities like "follow" (tail, shadow=walk?, fish=hook?) or "rest" (nap) are weaker. Prioritize the increase group.

High confidence as it perfectly matches four words with consistent slang/colloquial usage.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

These four form a clear category: ways to follow or pursue someone/something covertly or playfully. WALK (walk/fly/flee the plank? No—tail, fish, walk as in "walk tail"? Actually: TAIL (follow secretly), FISH (fish for information/compliments), WALK? Wait, better: all can precede "the plank" but no.

Refine: Pirate commands? No.

Strong connection: Informal ways to follow or track: TAIL (tail someone), FISH? No.

Think: TAIL, WALK, NAP, FISH—no.

Pirate lingo? Walk the plank, but others no.

Actually: Words that can follow "cat": CATWALK, CATNAP, CATFISH, CATTAIL (cattail plant). Perfect! CATWALK (fashion runway), CATNAP (short sleep), CATFISH (fake online persona or fish), CATTAIL (marsh plant). This is a classic Connections "words that precede X" category, specifically "cat___".

Yes, fits perfectly: CATFISH, CATNAP, CATTAIL, CATWALK.

High confidence.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
