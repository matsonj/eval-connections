After analyzing, I identify four potential categories:

1. Eddie Murphy movie roles/characters: AKEEM (from Coming to America), DOLITTLE (from Dr. Dolittle), DONKEY (from Shrek), FOLEY (Axel Foley from Beverly Hills Cop). This is a strong, specific connection tied to a famous actor.

2. Words that can follow "king": CAKE (king cake), COBRA (king cobra), KONG (King Kong), TUT (King Tut). This fits as a classic "preceded by" category common in Connections.

3. Ways to move quickly: BARREL (barrel along), FLY (fly down the highway), RACE (race ahead), ZIP (zip by). These are synonyms for rapid movement.

4. Expressions of disapproval: BAD (as in "bad boy!"), SHAME ("shame on you"), TSK (tsk-tsk), TUT TUT (tut-tut). These are interjections or verbal scoldings.

All words are used exactly once across these groups, confirming a complete puzzle. I'm most confident in the Eddie Murphy group due to its precise pop culture link, so I'll guess it first to test and potentially lock it in.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The "king" category stands out strongly: CAKE (king cake), COBRA (king cobra), KONG (King Kong), TUT (King Tut). These are clear associations where "king" precedes each word to form a famous phrase or name. This fits perfectly as a thematic group, leaving the other words for the remaining categories (expressions of disapproval and ways to move quickly).

I am analyzing potential categories. Several words seem related to ghosts or supernatural entities: SPIRIT (as in ghost), SPECTER (synonym for ghost), SHADE (another term for a ghost or soul), and WIGHT (an archaic or fantasy term for a ghostly being or undead creature). This forms a clear category of "ghost synonyms" or "types of apparitions." No other words fit this perfectly, so it's a strong isolated group.

Other potential categories like music genres (JAZZ, RAP, AMERICANA, CHORAL) or ways things break (SPLIT, BROKE, BURST, BLEW) exist but are less definitive. Prediction methods (DIVINE, FORECAST, READ, CALL) also seem plausible but secondary. Starting with the ghost category makes sense as it's the most cohesive.

My guess will be these four ghost-related words, as they align tightly without overlap.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Analyzing connections: A clear music-related category emerges with JAZZ, RAP (genres), AMERICANA (a roots music genre blending folk, country, etc.), and CHORAL (referring to choral music or ensemble singing styles). These all fit as music genres or forms without overlap.

Other potential groups include prediction methods (DIVINE, FORECAST, READ, CALL—like divining the future, forecasting, reading signs, calling shots) and breakage terms (BLEW, BROKE, BURST, SPLIT—like blew apart, broke, burst open, split). The music category feels the most distinct and genre-specific, so I'll target it next to clear it out efficiently.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Two clear categories remain. One is ways things can break or come apart suddenly: BLEW (as in blew apart), BROKE (past of break), BURST (burst open), SPLIT (split apart). These are all verbs or actions related to sudden breakage.

The other is methods of prediction: DIVINE (divine the future), FORECAST (predict weather or events), READ (read palms or signs), CALL (call the outcome).

The breakage category feels more direct and unambiguous, so I'll guess that first to confirm and eliminate strong synonyms.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Analyzing connections: DEED (title deed), HOUSE (houses you place on properties), HOTEL (hotels you place), TOKEN (player pieces) all directly relate to components in the board game Monopoly. This is a tight, thematic category typical for Connections, where game elements form a group.

The leftover words—PLANT, LODGE, WEDGE, STICK—likely connect as verbs meaning to insert or fix firmly in place (e.g., plant a flag, lodge in one's throat, wedge into a crack, stick in the mud). This confirms the Monopoly group as the next clear one to guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Identify potential categories: One strong connection emerges with expressions of having input or influence in a decision. Phrases like "have a choice," "have a say," "have a voice," and "have a vote" all relate to participating in or influencing a decision. These words—CHOICE, SAY, VOICE, VOTE—form a cohesive group under the category of ways to express or possess influence/opinion. No other words fit this perfectly (e.g., SPEAK is close but doesn't pair idiomatically as "have a speak").

Other potential groups (e.g., shoe types: FLAT, HEEL, PUMP, but no clear fourth; iron types: WAFFLE, STEAM, TIRE, possibly FLAT, but less certain) seem weaker or incomplete compared to this one. This appears to be the most straightforward and likely correct category to start with.

Logic for guess: Guess this group first as it has high internal consistency and covers a common idiomatic theme in Connections puzzles.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Re-analyzing connections: A strong, cohesive category emerges as dog commands—common in word puzzles. HEEL (walk at heel), DOWN (lie down), SHAKE (shake paw), SPEAK (bark on command). These four fit perfectly as standard dog training commands, with no outliers or stronger competing groups for these specific words.

Other potentials considered: Shoe styles (FLAT, HEEL, PUMP—but lacks a clear fourth without forcing); Milk-related (WHOLE, SHAKE—but only partial fit with no others like SKIM); Music notes (WHOLE, QUARTER—but only two, and SHAKE as musical term is weak).

Re-evaluate connections among remaining: A clear and cohesive category is musical notation terms. WHOLE (whole note, duration), QUARTER (quarter note, duration), FLAT (accidental/symbol lowering pitch), NATURAL (accidental/symbol restoring pitch). These four directly relate to elements in sheet music and note values/accidentals, a common puzzle theme. They fit tightly without forcing unrelated words.

Other potentials dismissed: Shoe types (FLAT, PUMP—but WAFFLE and TIRE don't fit well); Gas-related (NATURAL, STEAM—but incomplete and weak for four); Tire issues (FLAT, but only one clear).

I looked for clear connections. One strong category emerges: words that mean to evaluate or assess something—RANK (to order by merit), SCORE (to assign points or grade), GRADE (to classify or mark), RATE (to judge or appraise). These fit perfectly as synonyms for evaluation methods, common in Connections for abstract concepts like this.

Other potential groups: Makeup-related (BLUSH, MASCARA, perhaps DYE for hair), but it's incomplete—only three, and DYE is a stretch. Speed terms (PACE, CLIP as in "at a good clip," RATE, TRAIL as in lagging), but RATE overlaps with evaluation and TRAIL is weak. Nervousness indicators (FIDGET, SWEAT, BLUSH), but again, only three solid ones (needs a fourth like "stutter," which isn't here). TOWEL, STOCKINGS seem like clothing/items, but no clear quad. TIGER and NOSE might relate to animals or features, but nothing connects four.

Next, I scanned for connections. A clear category emerges for signs of nervousness or anxiety: BLUSH (reddening of the face from embarrassment), SWEAT (perspiring under stress), FIDGET (restless movement due to unease), PACE (walking back and forth when anxious). These are idiomatic expressions of nervous behavior, which fits Connections' style for behavioral or emotional categories.

Other potentials: Makeup items (BLUSH, MASCARA, DYE for hair color, but needs a fourth—STOCKINGS doesn't fit, and CLIP could be hair clip but that's more accessory). Speed or movement (PACE, CLIP as in "at a clip," TRAIL as in lag behind, but RATE is gone and it's weaker). Grooming (TOWEL, DYE, MASCARA, CLIP), but TOWEL is a stretch and doesn't connect cleanly. TIGER and NOSE might hint at animals (tiger nose?), but that's too vague. STOCKINGS and TRAIL could be outdoor/hiking gear with TOWEL (sweat towel?), but again, incomplete.

Scanning connections: A punny "run" category fits perfectly—things that can "run" idiomatically: STOCKINGS (a run in stockings), MASCARA (mascara runs when wet), NOSE (runny nose), DYE (dye runs in the wash). This is a classic Connections-style wordplay group, connecting all four seamlessly.

Alternatives: Beauty products (MASCARA, DYE, perhaps CLIP as hair clip, but TOWEL doesn't fit). Animals or features (TIGER, NOSE, TRAIL as tiger trail, but CLIP irrelevant). Clothing/items (TOWEL, STOCKINGS, CLIP as paper clip, weak).

Remaining words suggest separate categories (e.g., small pieces: KERNEL, NUGGET, TIDBIT + ?; money amounts: BUNDLE, PILE, FORTUNE + ?), so this purple group is the most complete and confident next guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Potential groups: One clear connection is words that can mean a large amount of money—BUNDLE (as in bundle of cash), MINT (as in "make a mint" or worth a mint), PILE (pile of money), FORTUNE (great wealth). This is a classic slang/idiomatic category for substantial sums. The remaining words (KERNEL, NUGGET, TIDBIT, PEARL) suggest small pieces or bits (e.g., kernel of truth, nugget of wisdom, tidbit of info, pearl of wisdom), which could form the next group, but the money theme is tight and non-overlapping, making it the confident choice here.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

First, I identify a strong group related to cursing or bad language: PROFANITY (bad language), EXPLETIVES (curse words used to express emotion), SWEARING (the act of using curse words), and FOUR-LETTER WORDS (euphemism for short swear words like those considered taboo). This is a cohesive synonym category for terms associated with obscenities.

Other words hint at groups, such as the famous Christmas poem "'Twas the night before Christmas..." featuring HOUSE, STIRRING, MOUSE, and CHRISTMAS, but I'll guess the profanity group first as it's the most straightforward and doesn't overlap. Remaining words like NECKLACE and EARRING suggest jewelry, while HERRING and MYSTERY point to "red herring" in puzzles/mysteries, and MESH SHIRT/PLEATHER VEST seem like fashion items, but the profanity link is clearest for an initial guess.

This guess tests a core category without risking used words.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

A clear category emerges from the opening lines of the famous Christmas poem "'Twas the Night Before Christmas": "all through the HOUSE / not a creature was STIRRING, not even a MOUSE," directly tying to CHRISTMAS as the holiday theme. These four form a cohesive literary reference group, common in Connections for cultural allusions.

Other potentials like jewelry (NECKLACE, EARRING) are incomplete without two more matches, while HERRING and MYSTERY suggest "red herring" but lack direct ties to the other two needed. HISTAMINE and OUROBOROS feel more obscure or standalone. Fashion items (MESH SHIRT, PLEATHER VEST) might pair with something else, but the Christmas poem connection is the strongest and most thematic for this guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

A clear category now stands out as wearable items or apparel: NECKLACE (jewelry worn around the neck), EARRING (jewelry worn on the ear), MESH SHIRT (clothing item worn on the torso), PLEATHER VEST (clothing item, fake leather top worn on the torso). This fits Connections-style categories for fashion or body adornments, grouping accessories and upper-body garments cohesively. No overlaps with prior groups.

The remaining words (HISTAMINE, OUROBOROS, MYSTERY, HERRING) likely form another group, possibly related to misdirection or symbols (e.g., red HERRING in a MYSTERY, OUROBOROS as a symbolic loop, HISTAMINE triggering reactions), but the apparel connection is stronger and more direct for this guess to test and confirm.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

The remaining four words—HISTAMINE, OUROBOROS, MYSTERY, HERRING—must form the final category.

These connect through the theme of "misdirection" or "false leads/reactions," a common Connections wordplay category involving deception, overreactions, or loops that mislead:

- HERRING: As in "red herring," a deliberate distraction or false clue.
- MYSTERY: A genre or puzzle full of misdirections and red herrings to obscure the truth.
- OUROBOROS: The snake-eating-its-tail symbol represents an infinite loop or paradox, misleading perceptions of beginnings, ends, and progress (often used in puzzle or philosophical contexts to confound linear thinking).
- HISTAMINE: Triggers the body's allergic response, an overreaction or "false alarm" to harmless stimuli, misdirecting the immune system.

This ties together biological, narrative, symbolic, and idiomatic misdirections without overlaps. As the final group, it completes the puzzle logically.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I analyzed potential categories by grouping words with clear themes. One strong group is camera brands: OLYMPUS (known for cameras and lenses), FUJIFILM (film and digital cameras), POLAROID (instant cameras), and HASSELBLAD (professional cameras). This connection is direct and unambiguous, as all are well-known companies in photography. Other potential groups exist (e.g., Italian city-derived terms like BOLOGNESE, NEAPOLITAN, PARMESAN, VENETIAN; stadium features like JUMBOTRON, SKYBOX, SCOREBOARD, ASTROTURF; words containing rock band names like JOURNEYMAN/Journey, RUSHMORE/Rush, KISSCAM/Kiss, CREAMSICLE/Cream), but the camera brands stand out as the most straightforward to guess first, with no overlaps or ambiguities.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Analyzing connections: One clear group is stadium/arena features: JUMBOTRON (large video screen), KISSCAM (on-screen feature prompting kisses), SKYBOX (luxury seating), SCOREBOARD (displays game info). These are all specific elements found in sports venues, forming a tight, thematic category without overlaps. ASTROTURF (synthetic turf) could fit but is more field-specific, so I'm prioritizing the four above for precision.

Other potentials: Italian-derived terms (BOLOGNESE from Bologna, NEAPOLITAN from Naples, PARMESAN from Parma, VENETIAN from Venice) – strong but mixed (sauces, ice cream, cheese, blinds). Rock band names hidden inside words (JOURNEY in JOURNEYMAN, RUSH in RUSHMORE, KISS in KISSCAM, CREAM in CREAMSICLE) – clever but KISSCAM overlaps with stadium group. Ice cream types (CREAMSICLE, NEAPOLITAN) – too few.

Clear groupings emerge: One is words containing rock band names – KISSCAM (KISS), JOURNEYMAN (JOURNEY), RUSHMORE (RUSH), CREAMSICLE (CREAM) – all classic rock bands embedded directly, a common Connections wordplay category. The other is Italian city-inspired terms – BOLOGNESE (Bologna, sauce), PARMESAN (Parma, cheese), NEAPOLITAN (Naples, ice cream), VENETIAN (Venice, blinds) – evoking styles or products named after Italian locales.

The rock band group is more distinctive and playful, fitting as a category, with no overlaps. Prioritizing this over the Italian one, as the prior incorrect guess freed KISSCAM perfectly for it, and wordplay often appears early in such puzzles.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Identify potential categories by grouping words with clear connections.

One strong category emerges in geometry/mathematics: LENGTH (linear dimension), AREA (two-dimensional measure), PERIMETER (boundary measure), VOLUME (three-dimensional measure). These are all standard terms for spatial measurements, fitting perfectly as a group without overlap.

Other potential groups include:
- Homophones for plural letters: ARS (R's), AYES (I's), EASE (E's), OWES (O's).
- Black-and-white things: CROSSWORD (puzzle grid), DOMINO (tile), OREO (cookie), ORCA (whale).

- Things composed of cells: HONEYCOMB (hexagonal cells), SPREADSHEET (grid cells), ORGANISM (biological cells), SOLAR PANEL (photovoltaic cells). This connection is strong and direct.
- Image editing terms: PHOTOSHOP, AIRBRUSH, TOUCH UP, FIX (as in repairing or adjusting an image).
- Christmas decorations: CANDY CANE, STRING LIGHTS, TINSEL, ANGEL (tree topper).
- French words for foods: PAIN (bread), CORNICHON (gherkin/pickle), PAMPLEMOUSSE (grapefruit), VINAIGRETTE (dressing).

- Image editing tools or actions: PHOTOSHOP (software), AIRBRUSH (tool/technique), TOUCH UP (editing action), FIX (as in correcting or editing an image).
This group is tightly connected through digital or photo manipulation themes, with no overlap to other potential groups.

Other potential groups remain: Christmas items (CANDY CANE, STRING LIGHTS, TINSEL, ANGEL) and French food terms (PAIN for bread, CORNICHON for pickle, PAMPLEMOUSSE for grapefruit, VINAIGRETTE for dressing).

This group ties together festive items commonly associated with Christmas trees and decor.

The other apparent group is French terms for foods: PAIN (bread), CORNICHON (pickle), PAMPLEMOUSSE (grapefruit), VINAIGRETTE (dressing), which is also strong but linguistic in nature.

Both are solid, but the Christmas theme feels more cohesive and puzzle-like, as it links physical holiday items directly. No overlaps or ambiguities. I'll go with the decorations group first due to its thematic unity.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

I analyzed potential categories by looking for synonyms, themes, and common associations. One clear group emerges as types of minor surface damage or imperfections: DENT (a small depression in a surface), DING (a small dent or nick), MAR (to damage or blemish the appearance), and SCRATCH (a mark or superficial injury). These are all verbs or nouns related to slight damages, often to objects like cars or furniture. This connection is strong and straightforward, common in Connections puzzles for "kinds of damage."

Other potential groups I noted include baseball field features (BASE, BOX, MOUND, PLATE), colossal sizes (COLOSSUS, MAMMOTH, WHALE, WHOPPER), and possibly subtle social behaviors (STARE, WHISPER, SNICKER, POINT), but the damage group is the most obvious and confident starting point.

Analyzing connections: A strong baseball-related category stands out. BASE refers to the bases on the field, MOUND is the pitcher's mound, PLATE is home plate, and BOX is the batter's box. These are all physical features or locations on a baseball diamond, a common theme in word puzzles for sports terminology.

Other potentials include enormous things (COLOSSUS, MAMMOTH, WHALE, WHOPPER as in gigantic), and subtle or quiet reactions (STARE, WHISPER, SNICKER, POINT as in judgmental gestures). However, the baseball group is precise and cohesive, so I'll prioritize it as the next guess.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

Looking for connections, a clear category of "colossal or enormous things" emerges: COLOSSUS (a gigantic statue or figure), MAMMOTH (vastly large, like the extinct animal or adjective for size), WHALE (the largest mammal), WHOPPER (slang for something huge, like a big lie or exaggeratedly large item). These all denote immense scale, a common thematic grouping in Connections for sizes.

The leftover words (STARE, WHISPER, SNICKER, POINT) seem to relate to subtle or judgmental behaviors, possibly "ways to express disapproval indirectly," but the enormous group is more definitive and solidified, so I'll guess it next to progress systematically.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

2. Ways to increase: CRANK (crank up), HIKE (hike up), JACK (jack up), RAISE. These are verbs meaning to elevate or boost something like volume, prices, or position.

3. Words preceded by "CAT": CATFISH (FISH), CATNAP (NAP), CATTAIL (TAIL), CATWALK (WALK). Each forms a common compound word or phrase with "cat."

4. Fictional spies' surnames: ARCHER (Sterling Archer from *Archer*), HUNT (Ethan Hunt from *Mission: Impossible*), PEEL (Emma Peel from *The Avengers*), POWERS (Austin Powers from *Austin Powers*). These are last names of iconic secret agent characters.

One strong group is famous or notable streets: DOWNING (Downing Street, UK PM residence), FLEET (Fleet Street, journalism hub), WALL (Wall Street, finance), MAIN (Main Street, symbolic American thoroughfare). This fits perfectly as "Famous Streets."

Other emerging groups include entrances (DOOR, GATE, HATCH, PORTAL), map elements (COMPASS, KEY, SCALE, INSET), and ways to surpass (BEAT, BEST, BETTER, TOP). But the streets group is the most straightforward and unique right now, with no overlaps or ambiguities.
