I looked for a set of four words that could all belong to a single, clear category.  
The words **BACKPEDAL, ABOUT‑FACE, FLIP‑FLOP,** and **RENEGE** are all terms that describe a reversal or a change of position—whether a physical motion or a shift in stance or policy.  
They share a common theme of “backing off” or “turning around,” which fits the requirement of a cohesive connection.  

This grouping is the most natural and specific connection among the available words.

&lt;guess&gt;
BACKPEDAL, ABOUT-FACE, FLIP-FLOP, RENEGE

I look for a clear, unambiguous category that can be satisfied by exactly four words.

One such category is “words that can function both as nouns and as verbs.”  
Checking each:

- **WEDGE** – noun (the shape) and verb (to wedge something).  
- **JAM** – noun (fruit preserves or congestion) and verb (to jam a device or traffic).  
- **STUFF** – noun (contents) and verb (to stuff).  
- **FLAG** – noun (banner) and verb (to flag down, to indicate).  

The other words either cannot be verbs or do not fit neatly into a single group with four members. Thus WEDGE, JAM, STUFF, FLAG form a valid set.

This matches the specification: four related words in a single category, and each word will be used only once.  
No conflicts with previous guesses remain.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

- RAIN‑BOW (rain + bow)  
- PIN‑WHEEL (pin + wheel)  
- WIND‑CHIME (wind + chime)  

None of the other words (WEDGE, JAM, STUFF, VANE, STREET) are compounds.

The remaining words are: WEDGE, JAM, STUFF, NEIGHBORHOOD, RAINBOW, VANE, PINWHEEL, STREET, WIND CHIME.  
I looked for a property that exactly four of these words share.  

Checking for double letters (two identical consecutive letters):  
- STREET – contains “EE”  
- STUFF – contains “FF”  
- PINWHEEL – contains “EE”  
- NEIGHBORHOOD – contains “OO”

None of the other words have a double letter (e.g., WEDGE, JAM, VANE, RAINBOW, WIND CHIME).  
Thus the set of four words that all contain a double letter matches perfectly, and no other word from the list does.  
This fits the requirement for a unique category of four related words.

STREET, STUFF, PINWHEEL, NEIGHBORHOOD

The remaining words are: WEDGE, JAM, RAINBOW, VANE, PINWHEEL, STREET, FLAG, WIND CHIME.  
We need a category that exactly four of these belong to.  
The words **VANE, PINWHEEL, WIND CHIME, FLAG** are all items that are traditionally hung on a pole, stick or porch.  
They are ornamental or functional objects that climb upward: a weather vane, a pinwheel toy, a wind chime, and a flag.  
None of the other remaining words (WEDGE, JAM, RAINBOW, STREET) fit this “hang on a pole” theme.  

Thus this set satisfies the requirement of a single clear category with exactly four members.

Looking for a category that includes exactly four of the remaining five words: **WEDGE, JAM, STUFF, NEIGHBORHOOD, RAINBOW**.  
A clear common connection that applies to four of these is that they are all **things that can be eaten or are food‑related**:

- **JAM** – fruit preserve, an edible spread.  
- **STUFF** – refers to “stuffing” or an edible filling.  
- **WEDGE** – commonly refers to a slice of food, e.g., potato wedge or wedge of ham.  
- **RAINBOW** – often used in food names such as rainbow cookie, rainbow pretzel, or rainbow cake.

**NEIGHBORHOOD** is the lone word that does not fit this food-related theme.  
Thus the four words that belong to the same category are **WEDGE, JAM, STUFF, RAINBOW**.

WEDGE, JAM, STUFF, RAINBOW

For the remaining words we need a distinct group of four that share a common meaning.

Looking at the unused words: BACKUP, HACK, SOMEDAY, COPPER, ALTERNATE, HERO, SHRINK, SUIT, SUB, FANTASY, COVER, HONEY.

One clear semantic cluster is the idea of a replacement or stand‑in:

- **BACKUP** – a spare or substitute.  
- **ALTERNATE** – to substitute or take the place of.  
- **SUB** – abbreviation for substitute.  
- **COVER** – also used in sports/teams to mean a stand‑in (e.g., “cover for” someone).

These four words are synonyms for “substitute/stand‑in”, while none of the phase‑change words share that meaning, so the the next guess is this replacement (stand‑in) category.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;
BACKUP, ALTERNATE, SUB, COVER

The two categories already solved are:

1. **Stand‑in synonyms** – BACKUP, ALTERNATE, SUB, COVER.  
2. **Phase changes** – VAPORIZE, FREEZE, MELT, CONDENSE.

Four words remain: HACK, SOMEDAY, COPPER, HERO, SHRINK, SUIT, FANTASY, HONEY.

A recognizable grouping among these eight is the set of words that can precede **“CODE”** or are used in a computing context: **HACK, SHRINK, SUIT, FANTASY** (as in hack, shrink wrap, suit code, fantasy code).  
The remaining four words, **COPPER, HONEY, SOMEDAY, HERO**, share the characteristic of being **colloquial or slang terms for people or roles** (copper = policeman, honey = term of endearment, hero = prominent figure, someday = informal future reference).

Thus the categories are:

- **Computing/tech terms** – HACK, SHRINK, SUIT, FANTASY  
- **Slang for people/roles** – COPPER, HONEY, SOMEDAY, HERO

Note: This grouping aligns with typical NYT Connections themes, where each category uses a single thematic relationship.

Now we need to pick one of the above groups as the next four‑word guess.  
I will go with the **computing/tech** group.

&lt;guess&gt;
HACK, SHRINK, SUIT, FANTASY

A common link that stands out is that all four of the words
**HACK, SHRINK, HERO, COPPER** are nouns that denote **a person or a role**:
- **Hack** – an unskilled worker or someone who hacks.  
- **Shrink** – a psychologist/psychiatrist.  
- **Hero** – a person admired for bravery.  
- **Copper** – slang for a policeman.

These four together form a clear, everyday category that fits the tone of the earlier
categories (state changes and stand‑in synonyms).  
The remaining four words (SOMEDAY, SUIT, FANTASY, HONEY) form a different category.

I looked for a set that shares a clear, everyday linguistic relationship.

A common puzzle category is “words that can form a noun referring to a person by adding a common suffix or by simply using the noun as a job title.”  
* HACK → **hacker** (a person who hacks).  
* SHRINK → **shrink** (a psychiatrist, a person in a job).  
* COPPER → **copper** (slang for a policeman).  
* SUIT → **suitor** (a person who sues someone, or a romantic partner looking to court).  

All four words can be turned into a noun that denotes a specific type of person – a specialized job or role – and the resulting nouns are distinct.  
No other combination of four of the surviving words presents such a tidy, single‑theme grouping, so this is the most plausible final category.

Thus the correct next guess is:</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

These four words are each a component of a famous song title.

We already used the four words related to song titles (BABA, HOTEL, STAIRWAY, BOHEMIAN) and the four words that refer to styles of underwear (BRIEF, BOXER, THONG, HIPSTER).  
The leftover four that best form a coherent category are **CHAIN, FLOAT, FLAPPER, PUNK** because each of these can precede the word *DANCE* to form a recognizable dance name:

- **CHAIN DANCE** – a traditional dance form in some cultures.  
- **FLOAT DANCE** – a dance performed on or around decorative floats (often seen in parades or festivals).  
- **FLAPPER DANCE** – the lively 1920s dance style popular among flappers.

* **BUMPER** – used in *bumper car*  
* **ROLLER** – used in *roller coaster*  
* **FERRIS** – used in *ferris wheel*  
* **BUGGY** – a small vehicle (e.g., sand buggy, dune buggy)

All four words pair with a type of vehicle or amusement‑park ride, giving a clear, singular category that hasn’t been guessed yet.

Thus the correct grouping is the “types of vehicle/ride” collection.

No other remaining four-word combination offers such a clean, unmistakable category, so this is the most likely correct answer.

The four words that stood out were **PEN, ROSE, ROGER, WHITE** because each can function as both a noun and a verb in standard English:

- **PEN** – noun (writing instrument); verb (to write with a pen, to enclose in a pen).  
- **ROSE** – noun (flower); verb (past tense of rise).  
- **ROGER** – noun (name); verb (British usage meaning “to acknowledge or approve”).  
- **WHITE** – noun (color); verb (to make white or whiten).

No other word among the remaining list comfortably fits this verb‑noun duality, so this set offers a clear, unique category.

The task is to pick four that belong to the same category.

I considered several possible categories:

1. **State‑abbreviation pattern** – JUROR (OR), TRIX (RI), SQUID (ID), DONUT (UT), MONTH (MO) each contain a consecutive US state abbreviation. That yields 5 candidates, so it cannot form a unique set of four.

2. **Words that are food items** – DONUT is clearly edible, VELVETEEN is a chocolate bar, SQUID can be served as food, and TRIX is a breakfast cereal brand. These four are all consumable foods, and none of the other two remaining words (JUROR, MONTH) fit this category.  

Other patterns (repeated letters, anagrams, etc.) either matched fewer than four words or produced multiple possible groups.  
Thus the most natural and unique grouping is the **food** category: DONUT, VELVETEEN, SQUID, TRIX.

This set is supported by common knowledge of each word as a food product.

Therefore my guess is:

- **DONUT**
- **VELVETEEN**
- **SQUID**
- **TRIX**

Setting aside any ambiguous uses, these four words all represent edible items, while the remaining two words do not.  
No other group of four among the remaining words is as clear or exclusive.

That is why I am confident this is the correct answer.</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

These words do not fit into any of the previous categories (beginnings, joining verbs, or acronyms).

A common grouping in NYT Connections is “words that can be paired with a particular

From the list the most reliable common pair is **“…UP”**:

- **POWERS** + UP → *powers up* (a ubiquitous gaming/tech phrase)

phrasal verb that means “to increase” or “to make stronger.”  
These words are:

- **CRANK** → *crank up* (to increase speed or intensity)  
- **JACK**  → *jack up* (to lift or raise)  
- **HIKE**  → *hike up* (to raise a price, etc.)  
- **POWERS** → *powers up* (to get more power/energy, i.e., to increase)

No other words in the list combine with “up” with this meaning, so the category
consists of exactly these four words.

This fits the NYT Connections style of a clear, single-move relationship.

Thus the correct guess is:</div></details><div>&lt;guess&gt;

All four pair with **DOG** to form well‑known terms, providing a clear, consistent category.  

Earlier the guess was rejected, likely because **DOG BELT** seemed weak, but it is a valid, commonly used phrase. This is the best fit for the remaining words.

The words **CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, SPARK, FIREWORKS** all directly relate to the idea of a spark or ignition – a spark is a chemical reaction, a connection can be an electrical link, and fireworks produce visible sparks. Those four form a clear group.

What remains is the complementary set of four words.  
The remaining words are **BANSHEE, WAILER, PIP, HEARTBREAKER**.  
Each of these can be described as a *term that signifies or hints at a cry or lament*:  
- **BANSHEE** – the mythical wailing spirit.  
- **WAILER** – something that wails.  
- **PIP** – the small “pip” sound of a tiny firecracker.  
- **HEARTBREAKER** – a person whose actions elicit sorrow or wailing.  

 these four together form a logical set that complements the fireworks/ignition theme.  
They are distinct from the fire‑spark group and fully exhaust the remaining words.

3. BANSHEE, WAILER, PIP, HEARTBREAKER – “screaming” or “cry‑related” terms  

Only four words remain unused: **CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, SPARK, FIREWORKS**.  
These words all associate with a theme of ignition or electricity:  
- A spark is the moment of ignition.  
- Fireworks are a large, public display of spark‑based explosions.  
- Connections (especially electrical) rely on sparks to transmit current or to ignite.  
- Chemistry is the science that explains how sparks form and propel reactions.  

Thus, the remaining four words form the theme “things related to sparks or ignition”.  
Therefore, the correct final group is exactly these four words.

- **SWEAT** – the perspiration produced during exertion.

These four words clearly belong together under the theme of “workout/physical activity.”

The words “HEAD”, “EAR”, “NOSE”–all clearly refer to parts of mammals or other animals.  
“WING” is also a body‑part used by many animals (birds, insects, bats).  
This grouping is the most obvious set of four that share a natural category (“parts of an animal”).  
The other words (ENGINE, CABIN, HOSE, BULB, CRAYON, HONEYCOMB, ROB, FLEECE, STALK, STIFF) are disparate, so I’m choosing the clear animal‑part cluster.

Thus my guess is four words that form the category “Parts of an animal”.

- **HEAD** – we say “head of lettuce”, “head of cabbage”, or simply the top part of a plant.
- **EAR** – an “ear of corn” or an “ear of wheat”.
- **STALK** – the stem or stalk of a plant.
- **BULB** – a bulb is a specialized plant organ (e.g., onion, tulip).

All four are familiar botanical parts, and no other subset of the remaining words forms an equally clear category. Therefore, the most likely correct set is the plant‑part group.
