HOW TO PLAY
1. Guess 4 related words that belong to the same category.
2. You'll be told "CORRECT", "INCORRECT", "INCORRECT - ONE AWAY" or "INVALID_RESPONSE" with details.
3. If a word has been correctly guessed, it shall not be used again.
4. You have at most 6 total guesses (4 incorrect answers allowed).
5. Once you have guessed 4 correct distinct sets, the puzzle is solved.

SCORING
You are scored on three criteria, in priority order:
1. Solve rate: Did you complete the puzzle? This is all that matters for correctness.
2. Cost: Every token you generate costs money. Cheaper solves are better.
3. Speed: Faster solves are better, but this is secondary to cost.

Incorrect guesses give you free information - use them to narrow the solution space. You are only penalized for incorrect guesses if you fail the puzzle.

With 4 incorrect guesses available, guess quickly early on. Save deeper analysis for when you have 1-2 incorrect guesses remaining.
